Gulls wheeled in the skies over the capitol of the Western Realm, weaving daring 
circles about the parapets of the palace, narrowly avoiding the Princes 
standards which fluttered in the salty breeze. Below, the city folk of Krondor 
took little notice of the majestic display as they hurried about their own 
affairs.<p>

The path turned.<p>
After a few minutes of travelling, the road bed began to slope towards the sea, 
leading eventually through a pair of iron gates and into the majestic seat of 
the principality.<p>
"Krondor," Locklear said with a sigh that seemed to indicate both relief and concern. 
"If assassins have been sent against us, it seems a safe bet they'll be lying in 
wait for us between here and the palace. What's your guess, Gorath? Do we go in 
now or not?"<p>

Owyn snorted.<p>
"The market district in Krondor?" he said, containing his amusement. "Why don't 
we just take all our possessions and GIVE them away instead? The Mockers are 
thick as porridge in there and the local merchants hike up the prices accordingly.
We'd be better off buying OUTSIDE of the city."<p>

While many of the things in the shop glittered gold or silver, Locklear was 
travelled enough to know that the items of greatest value were not on display.

A sign hung on the wall.<p>

<i>Mender On Call. Ask the Shopkeeper!</i><p>

The shopkeeper whistled.<p>

Cringing at the sound, Locklear glanced up to see what bargain the keeper wished to 
call their attention to, but instead it seemed the man was calling to someone 
else. "Didn't mean to startle you," the man said. "Just trying to find if my 
mender is still about today."<p>

"You have a tinker in your employ?" Locklear asked.<p>

"Sometimes, when he chooses to show up," the shopkeeper said amiably. "He can 
fix nearly anything - crossbows, armor, swords. You name it. And his work looks 
like brand new. Would you like to speak to him?"<p>

Locklear made a face as he shook the bars.<p>
For all the troubles he had been through to get them all alive to Krondor, the 
locked palace gates simply added insult to injury. Calling out to the gatemaster 
angrily, he pounded the hilt of his sword against the portcullis.<p>
Stirred by the racket, a young man liveried in the colors of the Krondorian 
Lancers strode out of his watch house and squinted at them, snapping up his 
bardiche which leaned against the interior wall.<p>
"Would you get this gate open, please?" Locklear said. "We have business with 
the Prince."<p>
"Can't help you, Seigneur," the guard replied. "The gate mechanism's broken, has 
been since three nights ago. Unless you and your companions have a mind of 
climbing the walls, there won't be any getting through here until we can find 
the plans for the portcullis. The castle engineer is absolutely livid."<p>
Locklear accepted the news with irritation, but knew of nothing else that could 
be done. "Could you go and get Prince Arutha for me then? It's a rather urgent 
matter."<p>
Again the guard shook his head. "He's meeting with Pug of Stardock and some 
Tsurani fellow named Makala. Gave explicit instructions he wasn't to be 
disturbed unless the castle was burning down around their ears."<p>
"Could you at least find Seigneur James..."<p>
The guard cut him off with a shake of his shaggy head. "Been missing for two 
days. No one knows quite where he's off to, but you know how James can be."<p>
Locklear nodded. "All too well. My bump of trouble tells me he's looking for 
whoever sabotaged the gate."<p>
"Sabotaged?" The guard looked puzzled, as if the thought hadn't occurred to him. 
"Why would anyone do that?"<p>
"I'm not sure, but if the thought occurs to me, I can guarantee that it has 
occurred to Seigneur James." Resheathing his sword, Locklear bid the guard 
farewell and motioned for his companions to follow him.<p>
"I have a feeling that the only way to solve both our problems is by going 
through the sewers that lead beneath the city," Locklear whispered, hurrying 
them to the northern gate. "There is a secret passage that will lead us into the 
palace, and I also suspect that we may bump into Seigneur James down there as 
well."<p>
