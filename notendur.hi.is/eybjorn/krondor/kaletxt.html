<h2>KALEM'S DIALECTIC ON ARROW FLIGHT</h2></center><hr>
<blockquote><blockquote><font size=+1>
Concise and poetical after a fashion, Kalem's book detailed many of the factors
that could affect a quarrel while in flight and the measures that could be taken
to compensate for crosswinds, bolts with poor spines, and targets that were
partially obscured. He further went on to recommend that archers consume 
Truesight Tea regularly as a means to sharpen their sight and advised the
reader to keep bowstrings and Aventurine handy to maintain crossbows.
