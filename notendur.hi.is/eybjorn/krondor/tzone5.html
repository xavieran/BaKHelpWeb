faced them, but a part of him entertained the notion that perhaps they had fallen onto the 
roadbed when someone had scrambled <i>up</i> the cliffs to await their party.<p>

Days passed.<p>
Disliking the exposed feeling created by the defile, they moved quickly during the nights and 
left the days to resting under rocky overhangs and listening for assassin's footsteps. At last, 
footsore and road weary, they emerged near the town of Tyr-Sog.

"Thank you so much! I just wish I had some way to pay you," she said with a slight scowl. Then 
she brightened, "You know, there are a few items that my sisters left behind when they moved a 
year ago and they never came back to retrieve them. They're just taking up space here and 
perhaps they will do you some good. Let me see if I can find them."<p>

She disappeared behind a cloth curtain that apparently separated the living area of the house 
from the work area. The curtains parted again and a smiling man entered the room.<p>
"Why yes, gentlemen. Have you come for a pair of shoes? Perhaps you'd like a pair for your lady 
friends, eh? I'm working on a new shoe design for ladies of high fashion." He held up a pair of 
shoes that had a thin two inch heel.<p>
James frowned. "Wouldn't it feel like you were walking down hill all day long?"<p>
The old man looked at James, then back at the shoe. "Ack. Maybe you're right. In any case. I 
have some fine footwear here if you're interested. The elves call them 'weedwalkers.' You just 
put them on under your boots and it somehow muffles the sound. Are you interested?"

so James knocked loudly and stood back to wait.<p>
A female voice called out to them from inside, "Who is it?"<p>
"Official Kingdom business, we need to speak with you," James said firmly.<p>
The door opened slowly on a woman who seemed surprised and dismayed to see them standing before 
her. "Please kind sirs, we didn't mean no harm. The house was abandoned when we found it." Her 
torn dress fluttered in the small breeze, just as her voice fluttered in her nervousness.<p>
Owyn noticed -- sensed perhaps -- that she was with child. "That's not why we have come. What 
can you tell us of this area? Anything out of the ordinary?"<p>
"No sirs. There ain't been much -- wait a minute. A detachment from Highcastle camped out just 
south of here and I think they left behind a couple boxes. Didn't look in 'em, though."<p>
James told the woman to stay in the house as long as she and her husband needed to stay there.
"I don't think the owner has any plans to come back here. Good-bye."

The stench of death hung heavy about the small tent.<p>
James pulled back the entrance flap, his breath held tightly in his chest. The decomposing body of 
a man lay slumped on the dirt floor amidst a variety of wood and metal tools.<p>
"Looks like a miner," James said quickly, trying not to breathe in through his nose. "Let's see if 
there is anything in here we can use."

James's knock was greeted with a giggle.<p>
The door was pulled open cautiously from the inside by two women. They seemed very nervous and 
giggled frequently as they introduced themselves.<p>
"I'm Gena Halfgate and this is my sister Andrea," the eldest began. Stifling another laugh she 
continued, "I hope you haven't come to hear us play."<p>
"Play?" inquired James.<p>
"My sister and I used to play our violins for all the lonely soldiers passing through, but of 
late we haven't had many guests and our instruments have gotten out of tune. Say! Do you have a 
tuning fork? If you had a tuning fork we would be ever so grateful."<p>
Seeing James's doubtful expression she said, "We don't have much money we could offer, but a 
soldier left behind some leather leggings we have no use for. Will you trade us a tuning fork 
for some leather leggings?"

He pulled a silver colored tuning fork from his pack and offered it to the sisters, who tittered

The community barn at Dencamp on the Teeth was of the usual variety. The occupants were also a 
standard mix of cows, sheep and chickens. Still, James decided it would be worth a look around.<p>
It was obvious the barn hadn't been shoveled out in some time and the stench was nearly 
unbearable. He was just about to leave when his eye spotted something shiny. He kicked aside
some dirt and hay with his foot. The darkness made it difficult to see, so he bent down to take
a closer look... It was a single gold coin that caught his eye, but now upon closer inspection 
he could see that there were actually nine of the little treasures spilling out of a small 
clothbag.<p>
"Well, I guess I'll have to appropriate these funds for Kingdom business," James muttered to

James knocked.<p>
A red haired man opened the door and looked them over cautiously. Apparently satisfied, he 
extended an invitation into his home and helped them fill their pouches with fresh water.<p>
"What can you tell of Dencamp on the Teeth?" James asked the man innocently.<p>
"What sort of information are you looking for? If you're here about that group down the road, 
I can tell you I don't think they were too successful."<p>
James played along, "Oh? And why was that?"<p>
"Well," the man replied, "seems there was all kinds of activity up North. Got set upon by at 
least three Goblin bands. Finally figured out how to kill THEM, then the Trolls got after them!"<p>
"They found out how to kill Goblins?" asked Owyn incredulously. "How?"<p>
The man shook his head, "Don't rightly know. You'd have to ask them. Oh, one more thing, they'll
want a password or they won't even let you in. Tell them it's 'Golden treasure.'"<p>
They thanked the man for his water and hospitality, then left.

The red haired man answered after the third knock.<p>
"Yes? -- Oh, it's you fellas again." he said.<p>
James stood in the doorway, hands on his hips. "We tried to talk to your friends down the road
but it appears that 'Golden Treasure' is NOT the password."<p>
The man looked puzzled for a moment, then began to speak rapidly, "Oh, that's right. I'm so 
sorry! Let's see... What was that password? They wanted me to join 'em so they told me that it 
was... oh, I remember. It was 'diamonds.' Yeah, that's what it was."<p>
James stared at the man coldly. "I hope you are right this time. If not, expect another visit from 
us -- and next time we won't be so friendly."

there were numerous footprints of various sizes in the dirt.<p>
His mind snapped back to the door as a loud voice asked, "What is the password?"<p>
James looked at Owyn, who simply shrugged, then he looked back at the door and said, "Password?"<p<

Momentarily, a loud male voice boomed at them from inside the house. "What is the password?"
the speaker commanded.<p>
"Golden treasure," replied James confidently.<p>
"That is NOT the password! What is the password?"<p>
At a loss for words, James paused. As the booming voice repeated itself, he toyed with the idea of 
demanding entrance for Kingdom business, but the image of a dozen armed men dissuaded this 
notion. "Now what shall we do?" asked Owyn, backing away from the door.

James knocked, his knuckles were becoming quite familiar with this particular door.<p>
"What do you want?" yelled the voice.<p>
"We know the password. It's 'Diamonds.'"<p>
There was a pause and James thought he could hear whispering and murmuring inside. Then the 
booming voice spoke again. "You may enter."<p>

The scarred door swung open and they were allowed into the house. Roughly a dozen men were 
crammed inside, most holding swords. Several were sporting fresh injuries.<p>
After a brief discussion they discovered that the group had planned a raid into the Northlands 
to recover a valuable treasure rumored to be kept there. They had encountered much more 
resistance than expected, so they were courting more able bodied men for the next attempt.
But what James was really interested in, was how they had managed to kill so many Goblins...<p>
"Got ourselves a magician. That's what we done!" boasted one of the men in response to James's 
question. "Burned those Goblin's brains out with some spell. Really seemed to drive 'em crazy. 
Poor Lionel. The spell didn't work so well on the Troll what killed 'im." There were murmurs of 
"poor Lionel" all around the room.<p>
As they were preparing to leave, one of the men motioned to a small chest in the corner.
"Lionel left a magic scroll in there, perhaps you can figure out what to do with it," he said.

The front door was scratched heavily, as though by swords. His own sword drawn, Gorath cautiously 
ventured inside. The weather beaten exterior of the house was in better shape than the ransacked

throughout the house.<p>

The remains of a sheep lay just inside the door to the barn, its body a twisted bloody mass of 
bone and wool.<p>
Owyn stood open mouthed, breathing heavily. It was obvious that the animal had been carved with a 
knife, and that the carver was after its meat. What disturbed him was the brutality with which 
the act had been carried out. Blood had splattered everywhere and there were bits of dried meat 
on the walls and ceiling, probably flung there by the knife as it violently hacked in and out of
the defenseless creature. Other animals in the barn had met a similar fate.<p>
Owyn thought it strange how the sight of men killed in combat had no more effect than the scene
laid out before him. After a moment's hesitation he decided it was time to leave.
