Locklear motioned to the figure across the room.<p>

The woman nodded, then made her way across the wooden floor until she was standing before them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>BEYLA:</font>
Among you there are injured that need looking after. The ship should return here soon. I would 
advise you seek help as soon as possible.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
But that's why we've come. The shipmaster in Silden said we could find a healer on this island 
who could help us.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>BEYLA:</font>
You have been misinformed. I am not a priestess of Sung and Eortis concerns himself solely with 
the denizens of his kingdom of the sea. He may act only on their behalf. Thus is his purpose as 
deigned by the will of Ishap, the One Above All.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
When I was young, I was fortunate enough to have learned something about how the temples all 
worked. I thought I remembered that a god can sometimes be compelled outside his purpose in 
return for a duty of obeisance.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>BEYLA:</font>
That is true, but Eortis is but a shadow of what he once was.  Upon a time, before the Valheru 
warred with the gods of Midkemia, his influence was as the depth and breadth of the seas and 
all that moved across them. When at last he vanished, Killian assumed control of his realm but 
here some essence of what he was still survives. We can not communicate with a god that is lost.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
But if we were to act on his behalf, do you think he would grant us favor?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>BEYLA:</font>
I cannot know. If there were more than an essence of him in this place, perhaps we could commune
with him and learn his thoughts, but we of the order of Eortis are the servants of a vanished 
god. We see his will only in very small ways.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Perhaps we are here to serve that will. What can we do to help you?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>BEYLA:</font>
I can see no harm in your request, but I can guarantee you no measure of success or failure in 
your efforts. I can depend only on what the omens may tell me. Perhaps Eortis will stir from his
slumber to grant his favor. Until then, the Mist Devil will bring you no longer to this Isle.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Could you at least give us an idea of where to start? You may be able to read the god's will in 
the falling of a sparrow, but some of us are not half so clever.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>BEYLA:</font>
Of late, we have had many tell us the rusalki who sometimes linger near the rivers have become 
disturbed. If you may find them all and lay them to rest, it might serve your purposes. I will 
warn you however that many of these sisters of Eliaem are wily and will find ways to hide their 
presence. Many do not wish to be sent into the halls of Lims-Kragma. You will need to be clever 
in finding them... This is my advice.<p>

As they filed out of the inner sanctum, Beyla suddenly dropped to her knees behind them. They 
rushed to her side but she had already gained her feet as they reached her.<p>

"I am sorry," she said breathlessly. "Eortis' touch is sometimes overwhelming. Though I cannot 
understand the meaning of it, something in you has aroused his interest and he has smiled on you
this day. Good luck to you."<p>

Locklear motioned to the figure across the room.<p>

The woman nodded, then made her way across the wooden floor until she was standing before them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>BEYLA:</font>
I have been expecting you for many days. My auguries have shown strangers that walk in the favor
of Eortis would be coming to us here and now I see you standing before me. You have pleased the 
god well.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
We have? What exactly did we do?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>BEYLA:</font>
You would know this better than I. I have no way of telling, except that I must assume in some 
way your actions have bettered the affairs of those who live either in the sea or in the rivers 
which feed it, those realms over which our lord once had dominion. But now, I have had a dream 
and was instructed to receive you well. The Swimmer of the Deeps has allowed I may grant you a 
boon. So long as you all shall live, any of you that come and petition before me shall be healed
of anything that ails you. Such is the nature of Eortis' favor. Have any of you the need of 
healing?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>BEYLA:</font>
I have been expecting you for many days. My auguries have shown strangers that walk in the favor
of Eortis. I assume that you must have completed your rites.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
It had very little to do with ritual, High Priestess, and much more to do with slaying spirits.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>BEYLA:</font>
You sound somewhat distressed. Be assured that you have slain no one, but have freed those from 
this world which were unnaturally bound here. The Swimmer of the Deeps is pleased and has 
allowed I may grant you a boon. So long as you all shall live, any of you that come and petition
before me shall be healed of anything that ails you. Such is the nature of Eortis' favor. Have
