THE CHAPTER BEGINS<p>
</font>
</center>

<blockquote>

The coppery smell of burning flesh filled the air.<p>

Embers leapt from the funeral pyre into the growing dusk, joined the 
winking points of light that would later become a blaze of crystalline 
stars. Around the flames villagers gathered in dark clots, their faces 
overwritten with blank, unreadable expressions. Like moths to a candle 
they drifted near and mourned and thought and sniffed. They had come to 
watch the flames feed.<p>

Gorath's fathomless green eyes nictitated in the firelight as he turned 
and gazed at Owyn who flinched uncomfortably at his side.<p>

"There can be no uneasier sleep than a warrior murdered in his cups," 
Gorath said, his voice only slightly louder than the spitting hiss of 
scorched bone. "They nipped at the heels of the Nighthawks, be certain 
of that."<p>

"So you think we're getting close?" Owyn asked.<p>

Gorath began to speak, but his words congealed on his lips as his eyes 
locked with the burning gaze of Seigneur James.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I've had it with your mysterious half-answers, moredhel! Now for the 
sake of your continued good health, I want to hear some explanations 
fast why you were here in Romney a six-month before you made your 
appearance at the Inclindel Pass.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
The only explanation, Seigneur, is that you are mistaken. I have never 
been south of the Inclindel...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
While we carried the dead from the Black Sheep Tavern, a tavern boy 
informed me that a man answering to your description called on three 
unwholesomes dressed in black, all of whom wore the trademark silver 
rings of the Nighthawks. He heard them refer to the moredhel as Gorath.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
It seems that this moredhel paid a sizeable sum of money to those 
Nighthawks before departing, enough perhaps to arrange the death of a 
company of the King's soldiers?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
He may well have paid a king's death, but I know nothing of it. I 
realize it may impress little upon you, but Gorath is a passing common 
name in the Northlands and oft as not your Kingdom fellow folk have 
mistaken me for an elf! The barkeeper was likely deceived by enemies of 
mine.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
If I had cause to mislead you or your Prince, I would have found a far 
less convoluted means of confusing the royal sanity. Look elsewhere for 
your enemies, James. While we may not be friends, I mean you no harm.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I shall look where I wish until you are no longer my responsibility.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
We may not be able to strike at the Nighthawk stronghold, but if we can 
locate it, we may still be able to get inside and find the information 
Prince Arutha needs.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
The Nighthawks will shun Romney for a time. However bold they may be in 
their murderous nights, they flee when daylight breaks.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
No one walks without leaving footprints and these men are no different. 
However skilled they may be at assassination, they have never been any 
good at covering their tracks. Let me see those things you found in the 
tavern.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
They are here.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Good. Those are our footprints. Of all the items we found on the dead 
company, both those items seemed conspicuously out of place and may be 
related in some way to our elusive murderers.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
We begin our hunt for the Nighthawks with a spider and a spyglass.<p>

THE CHAPTER ENDS</font><br>
<font size=+1>Opening the DARKNESS Chest in Cavall Run</font><p>
</center>

<blockquote>

Spiders scurried out of the opened chest.<p>

Careful to avoid the miniature albino menaces, James snatched a
fresh-looking scroll out of the box and unrolled it on the floor. As his dark 
eyes darted across the page, his lips moved in an incantation of 
places, names, figures and dates.<p>

"Northwarden," James whispered. "The attack will come at Northwarden 
very soon. But this is all wrong."<p>

"What is it?" Gorath asked, also bending to see the page.<p>

"These figures. If Delekhan takes a force this small to Northwarden, he 
hasn't a hope of taking the castle. Far too few soldiers. Baron Gabot 
will maul him unless Delekhan can bring something serious to bear. What 
could the moredhel have?"<p>

"Maybe the Nighthawks have infiltrated the castle." Owyn said. "Why 
else would they be so helpful to the moredhel unless their own necks 
were on the line too?"<p>

Paling, James suddenly snatched an ink horn from his pack and began to 
scribble an addendum to the Nighthawk note.<p>

"It is very important that this note reach Arutha. Although you were 
not told this, he has stationed an army outside of the Dimwood to await 
my word about the attack," James said, finishing his note. Fixing his 
gaze on Gorath, he handed it firmly over. "I want you to make sure that 
it gets there. I'm going to have to trust you."<p>

Owyn gaped. "But what about..."<p>

"I've got to go to Northwarden. If there are Nighthawks in Baron 
Gabot's castle, we stand a good chance of losing it in an attack. I 
have to ensure that doesn't happen.<p>
 
"Remember, Arutha is outside the Dimwood forest near Sethanon. When you 
give him the note, tell him there's a party at Mother's."<p>

"What?" Owyn sputtered.<p>

"Just do it. I haven't got time to explain. Good luck, the both of 
you."<p>

In a moment the Seigneur was gone, his shadows chasing after him down 
the long dark tunnel.<p>

An hour later, Owyn yawned expansively, his vision growing dim with 
each step taken further down the road. Next to him, Gorath trudged 
without complaint, his eyes fixed on the dusty cow track.<p>

"Enough, enough." Owyn murmured. I think my legs are going to crumble. 
We can't reach Arutha tonight. Let's stop for a while."<p>

"Quiet," Gorath snapped, seizing Owyn by the arm. Beneath his hood, his 
feral eyes glowed like blood tinged emeralds. Someone's near..."<p>

Abruptly patches of darkness detached themselves from the woods, ambled 
into the pale moonlight, huddled onto the roadbed. In the shadows, 
arrow points gleamed, aligned in deadly sights, quivered...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NARAB:</font>
As much as I would enjoy delivering your carcass to Delekhan I will 
reserve the pleasure of your execution for him.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NARAB:</font>
Do not move, Gorath. You are completely surrounded.<p>
