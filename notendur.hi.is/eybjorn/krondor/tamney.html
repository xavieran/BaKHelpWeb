Music drifted on the wind.<p>

At first believing himself losing his wits to the grind of travelling, Locklear paused, then 
picked out the very melodic strains of <i>The Shores of Carse</i> coming from a clump of
trees near them. Abruptly the music stopped as an unhappy looking young man dropped out of a 
tree, his lute slung over back.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>TAMNEY:</font>
I've just come from Northwarden and I don't feel like playing for him anymore today. My fingers 
are numb, my mind empty, and my stomach grumbling.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Calm yourself. We haven't come from the castle. We're just travellers wandering through who 
heard your music and thought we would see who was responsible. So, what is a songbird doing 
among the falcons?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>TAMNEY:</font>
Expiring, I fear. Do you know that I can sing the love theme from <i>Aelia and Tryphus</i>, I 
can play most of the <i>Rise of the Kingdom</i> cycle and I know by heart the whole of the
<i>Tears of Valerinsis</i>. But these men, these monsters only have one song they want to hear 
and they ask for it over and over --- <i>The Old Man's Wind</i>! A song about, about...eating 
beans!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Why do you stay here then?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>TAMNEY:</font>
I haven't the choice! While sharing a cask of ale with a friend, he told me of a small village 
where the wine was exceptionally strong and the ladies exceptionally thin. Once sobered, I 
resolved to take myself to this wondrous place and avail myself of its pleasures. To my horror, 
I found that my friend had mixed his metaphors and I was laid upon by a lady who could tear the 
teeth from a bull bare-handed. Before I could extricate myself from such humiliable 
circumstances, her father, a Baronet of some note, exiled me here to entertain for the Baron 
Gabot or else sacrifice my head.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
I'm surprised he didn't have you beheaded...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>TAMNEY:</font>
Well, his daughter was less than maidenly and secondly, he hadn't his fealty to pay for the
year. As the Baron Gabot is fond of music, they settled that I should make even the debt...<p>
I see that you are a noble of some note. If you could do me a favor, perhaps you could ease
the stress of a minstrel's life.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Perhaps. What can you want?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>TAMNEY:</font>
A length of light bowstring. While it is not immediately useable to me, I have found a resin 
that can be applied to it that will allow me to restring my lute. I have a feeling that I may 
need new strings soon.<p>

A favor for a favor then! Over the past few weeks there have been several sows stolen from 
Northwarden, so I wrote this little song to commemorate the event. It's silly and short, but 
I hope you like it. It's called <i>Northwarden Pigs</i>.<p>

<font color=#ff6600>
<font size=+1>
-- Northwarden Pigs --<p>

In the North the moredhel<br>
Are vicious to a man.<br>
Get too close they'll run you through<br>
Any way they can!<br>
But know at night the Kingdom's safe<br>
With 'Warden at the pass,<br>
But count your piggies by the dawn.<br>
The soldiers lose 'em fast.<br>
They squeal with joy and oink delight<br>
These piggies of the realm.<br>
But count 'em up head and all.<br>
The soldiers lose 'em fast.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Thank you, Tamney. That was most enjoyable, but I am afraid that my companions and I must be 
off again. Things to do.<p>

I bid you farewell then. Come and see me again.<p>

Music drifted on the wind.<p>

At first believing himself losing his wits to the grind of travelling, James paused, then picked
out the very melodic strains of <i>The Fishwife's Daughter</i> coming from a clump of trees 
near them. Abruptly the music stopped as an unhappy looking young man dropped out of a tree, his
lute slung over back.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>TAMNEY:</font>
Please tell me <i>he</i> hasn't sent you. I'm too exhausted right now to play and I've run all 
the things I know into the ground.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Hmm. I've heard it's a dire day in the keep when the minstrel is without charm. What's bothering
you?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>TAMNEY:</font>
When one of the Baron's new recruits asked for musical instruction, I heartily agreed, 
sacrificing my morning walks to make time for his lessons. We started immediately. I demonstrated 
for him a simple royal scale - ascending eighth notes, progression from Cabdicant to Acoronant 
in half steps, Kingdom time. Even after two weeks he couldn't find all the notes. He refuses to 
practice, he can't tell the difference between a tuned and untuned lute, and he patently refuses
to learn how to read minstrel writs. I don't understand why he desired lessons at all.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Perhaps he thought it would be easier.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>TAMNEY:</font>
Everyone does. They believe you simply pick up an instrument and it magically makes sounds of 
its own accord without so much as a whit of your concentration. Learning music takes discipline,
the same as learning how to use a sword.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Perhaps you could give us a lesson sometime.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>TAMNEY:</font>
You're in luck, I'm free just now and I've recently restringed my lute. There is, of course, 
the matter of a small fee which Baron Gabot imposes for services 
rendered outside of the garrison compliment. It would be seventy five sovereigns for the 
lesson. I realize it's a bit steep, but part of the cost covers the price of the 
practice lute itself. Do you still want the instruction?<p>

Have you changed your mind about the music lesson ? It's a handy thing to know how to play a

paradise. What do you say?<p>

We are your obedient pupils, musician. I already know where to find the notes on the lute, but 
beyond that I'm completely in the dark.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>TAMNEY:</font>
I'm sure of it. You'll find a lute there behind you.<p>

Play all scale the notes from middle C to the G in quarter notes, playing only the coronant notes
and then come back down to middle C again.<p>

Good. That is the royal scale. Now I want you to play the same scale but instead of playing E 
coronant, play the E abdicant. All the rest of the notes are the same.<p>

Exactly. That's the noble's scale. Together, the royal scale and the noble's scale are the basis
of most of our music, though we occasionally use the empress or Keshian scale. The empress'
scale is played by playing C coronant, D abdicant, E abdicant, progress to F coronant, G coronant, 
A abdicant, B coronant, and finally C coronant. I know it sounds complicated, but try it.<p>

You may master the lute yet. I want you to repeat the things that I've taught you for an hour 
every day. Once you can play those comfortably, we can have another lesson... Forgive me, but I 
have to go and prepare some songs for the Baron Gabot's dinner tomorrow night. Take care and

We are at your command, musician.<p>

Go ahead and use my spare lute. It's there behind you. Do me a favor and strum the strings.<p>

Ach, it's what I thought. I haven't gotten around to tuning it today. Okay, strum the top string.<p>
Since someone stole my tuning fork last week, we'll just have to call that string E. Now, put 
your finger on the fifth fret of the first string and strum the first and second strings 
together.<p>

Okay, that's good. The second string's in tune. Try doing the same thing with the second and 
third strings.<p>

The third string is a bit abdicant. Turn the tuning peg for the third string until the two 
strings are in harmony.<p>

Try the fourth string now.<p>

Good. The fifth string is a bit odd. Rather than putting your finger on the fifth fret, put your
finger on the fourth fret of the forth string and strum the fourth and fifth.<p>

And the last string is tuned like the second string. Finger on the fifth fret, fifth string and 
strum the fifth and sixth.<p>

Excellent...unfortunately, I don't have time to teach you anything else but at least now you'll 
know how to tune your instrument - after all, if your lute is out of tune, how will anyone know 
you're playing the song correctly? Please forgive me, but I've got to get an arrangement put 
together before dinner time tomorrow night, so I have to go. Keep practicing. You're showing 
real promise.<p>

comes down to it, you ain't got the picture. Instead you got's this yella streak - ya never 
stand and eyeball your problems face ta face, ya let other folks run you around. One day 
somebody's gonna run your life right off a cliff.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>TAMNEY:</font>
I'm the one telling me to leave Northwarden. Me. That's Tamney the Minstrel's decision, not 
someone else's. I'm making the decision to live.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PATRUS:</font>
The moredhel done run you off an they ain't even got here yet. They done a better job on you 
than any duke or baron you crossed swords with before. I'd not be in a castle with a coward 
like you anyway.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>TAMNEY:</font>
That isn't fair. I'm a minstrel! What good would I be...I don't know how to use a sword, I 
don't know how to heal wounds or direct a battle...I'd just be in the way. What good would I 
be? I'm just...one...insignificant...man.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Not so insignificant, Tamney. Before I went to serve in Krondor, my father used to advise me:
When you have earned your title, make sure your minstrel is well paid. I hadn't a clue what 
that meant until I saw the battles at Armengar and Highcastle and Sethanon and others since. 
When men sit and listen to songs about great battles, they remember men like themselves have 
faced terrible dangers and emerged alive and that gives them hope. Sometimes that's the only 
thing that an army needs.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>TAMNEY:</font>
But why do they all have to depend on me? Why did fate arrange it that I was the minstrel who 
happened to be at Northwarden?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
We aren't going to force you to go, Tamney. It's your life, your decision. If you choose to 
leave...that's your own business.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>TAMNEY:</font>
Could I request a favor of you before I make a final decision?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Anything, if it will set your feet back on the road to Northwarden.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>TAMNEY:</font>
There is a cave not too far from here that is known as the Diviner's Halls. Within, there are 
several small stones - called pattern stones by geomancers - which can foretell a man's future. 
If you return with one, I will make my decision.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PATRUS:</font>
Geomancy! Shoulda figured you'd go in for that hozum-pozum... Just another way for somethin 
else to make your hard decisions for you!<p>

Did you go to the Diviner's Halls? Did you bring back a pattern stone?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PATRUS:</font>
Don't get yourself into a tiz, Tamney. We got your silly rocks... Now you walkin' back to
Northwarden or are we draggin' you?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>TAMNEY:</font>
I will walk back myself after...I've studied the rock. Tell Baron Gabot that I will be there 
soon. I think he will be rather more relieved than you might imagine.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Oh? And why is that?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>TAMNEY:</font>
Before I was off from the castle, I had it in mind I wasn't to leave until I had at least made 
some provisions that I could survive. Even assuming I slipped out of the castle without notice, 
there was still the issue of how I would pay my way until I reached a safe haven. So, after a 
bit of investigation, I found the treasury. It was being guarded by a fellow by the name of 
Corbi, a fellow whose tryst with a certain girl by the name of Thea I have had the vicarious 
pleasure of orchestrating over the past several months. Once I had convinced him that she was 
awaiting him, it was a simple matter of slipping inside and grabbing up a pouch.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Not as if the Baron's missed a few golden sovereigns. I think he's involved with other things 
at the moment...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>TAMNEY:</font>
Exactly as I was thinking, but it seems that what I picked up in the dark was worth rather more 
than a few dozen sovereigns. Several hundreds more... Once I realized what I'd done, I became 
terrified of going back.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I could see why, but when the Baron told us to come and get you, he made no mention of missing 
money. It's entirely possible that no one has noticed the missing funds as yet. You can take 
them back to him.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>TAMNEY:</font>
I can't. Even if I return them, the Baron will be aware that Corbi left his post open for me to 
plunder. Though I can't say I've behaved much like a friend to him, I don't wish to betray him 
twice with the same crime... Actually, I have something of an admission to make. He is the 
reason why I asked you to retrieve the geomancy stones for me. They aren't worth much, even to 
a gem's dealer, but they can be used to make an attractive stone for a wedding band.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
For Corbi. Of course. So you've been considering returning all this time, but you wanted to 
wait until you could cover all possibilities...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>TAMNEY:</font>
All but one. I was wondering if you would take the pouch of diamonds and hold on to it until 
after the battle was over. This way, no one gets hurt and we can all do what we need to do. 
Tell him you took them off a dead Nighthawk or something.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
When you go back to the castle, its a possibility they will search you since your behavior has 
been a little odd. I'll take the diamonds, but I'll worry about how I will tell him later. My 
only concern is that you return immediately. We have other things we need to be doing for Duke 
Martin.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>TAMNEY:</font>
Done. I'll see you all back at the castle.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Don't be too happy about this, Tamney. You and I will have a big score to settle on later.<p>
Don't let yourself get killed getting back there.<p>

James motioned to the figure across the room.<p>

The man walked over to join them. He stood before them, eyebrows arched inquisitively.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>TAMNEY:</font>
Did you bring a pattern stone?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
We haven't found them yet. What do you think you'll find out from these rocks anyway?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>TAMNEY:</font>
Whether I will survive the battle at Northwarden or not. If not, I must send word to my
relatives.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
And you honestly believe staring at a rock is going to tell you that? That's nearly the dumbest 
thing I've ever heard.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
He's got a right to stupid ideas. If he just wants to sit here and wait for a rock to tell him 
that it's safe to come out into the daylight, that's all right by me. I say let him rot.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>TAMNEY:</font>
You're not going to humiliate me into making a decision, so you two might as well quit it. You 
may be Seigneurs, but right now I have more respect for rocks than I do anything that the two 
of you have to say. Goodbye.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Tamney, wait...<p>
