<ul>

<li><b>August 3, 1999 - BAK SOUNDS!</b><p>

<ul>
<li>

We are all very grateful to Paul Combetta for adding SOUNDS to the BAK HELP WEB.
Paul has extracted all the NPC Intros, and they have been added to the NPC Pages
in the <a href="textweb.html">Text Web</a>. I'm sure you'll enjoy them as much as I do!<p>

</ul>

<li><b>July 22, 1999 - SPECIAL UPDATE! BAK WEB ZIPPED!</b><p>

<ul>
<li>

Thanks to Paul Combetta's generous offer to host the zipped Help Web, I have
finally taken this step. You can now download the
<a href="zip.html">COMPLETE BAK HELP WEB</a>
in zip format.<p>

Unfortunately, I have been too busy to add anything to the Web recently. I'm
sorry about this.<p>

</ul>

<li><b>March 30, 1999 - SPECIAL UPDATE! BAK TEXT WEB!</b><p>

<ul>
<li>

For almost two months now I have been hard at work on the latest addition
to the Web:<p><a href="textweb.html"><font size=+2>The Betrayal at Krondor Text Web</font></a><p>
This will ultimately contain ALL TEXT IN THE GAME - dialogues, narratives,
descriptions, etc. I haven't nearly finished yet - in fact I only have a
vague idea what it's going to look like when it's done. It is definitely 
taking shape though, and some parts of it are finished enough for me to offer
you a peek at it. By all means tell me what you think - but please remember
it is *very much* under construction. It will take me at least another month
or two to get it into final shape.<p>

The NPC pages are (I think) more or less final, the Zone pages less so.
The Chapter pages are only skeletal as yet, and will undergo a lot of revision.
All of this text is hell to organize (as you will realize when you've taken a
closer look). I'm constantly adding and changing as I go along.<p>

I would never have *dreamed* of tackling this monster without the help of two
staunch supporters of the BAK Help Web, Bob Freimuth and Sean Corron. Bob
originally suggested the project, and isolated all the text from the game's
data files. Sean spent countless hours cleaning up the text files, and has
also created some beautiful graphics and logos for the NPC pages. He is now
working on additional graphics for the rest of the Text Web.<p>

Finally, I once more thank Fredrik Eriksson for the wonderful BaKHacker. As
you can imagine, I have had to test most of these dialogues in the game itself.
Without BaKHacker this would have been impossible.<p>   

</ul>

<li><b>February 3, 1999</b><br>

<ul>
<li>
Most ARMOR can now be LOCATED. The information is limited. Exact Locations
are provided if relevant. Standard Kingdom Armor and Elven Armor were left
out.<p>

</ul>

<li><b>February 2, 1999</b><br>

<ul>
<li>
Many SWORDS can now be LOCATED. The information is limited. Exact Locations
are provided if relevant. Broadsword, Two-Handed Broadsword, and Moredhel
Lamprey were left out - for obvious reasons.<p>

</ul>


<li><b>February 1, 1999</b><br>

<ul>
<li>
The LOCATE feature is now complete for POTIONS. No need to explain why RESTORATIVES
were left out! Added an unimportant feature to the LOOK and WALK Menus (thanx Bob and
Sean).<p>

</ul>


<li><b>January 29, 1999</b><br>

<ul>
<li>
The LOCATE feature is now complete for OTHER ITEMS. Some Items have been left
out, for obvious reasons. It would be stupid to list all sources of Manna, not
only because the list would be endless and incomprehensible, but mainly because
this has already been dealt with in the MAP WEB, in a comprehensible manner. Many
Quest Items have also been skipped. For example, what would be the use of stating
that Jared's Hand can be recovered from Glover in Lyton? The Walkthrough is needed.<p>

I'll be adding the LOCATE feature to the other Item pages soon, but only for SCARCE
and DIFFICULT-TO-FIND Items.<p>

</ul>

<li><b>January 27, 1999</b><br>

<ul>
<li>
I'm working on a new feature, intended to help you locate diffficult-to-find
Items. I've started (but not finished) <a href="other.html">OTHER ITEMS</a>.
Check it out, if you want, by clicking the [LOCATE] links. I'll be adding these
links as I go along. Just thought I'd let you know.<p>

WEBMASTER HINTS: A major new feature may be added to the Web soon, the TEXT WEB.
This will contain the complete TEXT of the Game, including all dialogues. This
is a *huge* project, which I wouldn't dream of doing all by myself. Fortunately the BAK
Web has FRIENDS, willing to donate time and effort. Bob Freimuth has made this
project possible, and Sean Corron is working on it.   
<p>

</ul>

<li><b>January 23, 1999</b><br>

<ul>
<li>Webmaster groans: I've just fixed and uploaded approximately 300
Combat pages. They looked fine in my old Browser, but in my new Browser
long Item Names (like STANDARD KINGDOM ARMOR) have decided to WRAP! Gosh.
So I checked every single Combat Page, and fixed the misbehaving ones. Hope
I didn't miss any.
<p>

</ul>


<li><b>January 22, 1999</b><br>

<ul>
<li>New Chapter 9 Walkthrough uploaded. Revisions finished. Some minor
changes to the earlier Walkthroughs.
<p>

</ul>

<li><b>January 20, 1999</b><br>

<ul>
<li>New (and much expanded) Chapter 8 Walkthrough uploaded. Only one more Chapter left!
<p>

</ul>

<li><b>January 18, 1999</b><br>

<ul>
<li>New version of the Chapter 7 Walkthrough uploaded. The old version
was totally out of tune with the rest of the Web, so I just rewrote it
from scratch. I don't think anyone will complain - the old version was
awful. Thank Ishap it's gone, now it will embarrass me no more.
<p>

</ul>

<li><b>January 14, 1999</b><br>

<ul>
<li>New version of the Chapter 6 Walkthrough uploaded. This was *very*
difficult, and has been *extremely* expanded, especially in the Elvandar
Area. As a result, the page is probably TOO BIG.<br>If it is, I'm sure I'll
be receiving complaints soon enough. I don't WANT TO split it into smaller
pages, but will if I must.
<p>

</ul>

<li><b>January 8, 1999</b><br>

<ul>
<li>New version of the Chapter 5 Walkthrough uploaded.
<p>

</ul>

<li><b>January 7, 1999</b><br>

<ul>
<li>New (and substantially expanded) version of the Chapter 4 Walkthrough.
Minor change in Chapter 3 (new Lecture Ticket).<p>

FIRST TIME USER, PLEASE NOTE: The Walkthroughs are being rewritten and
linked to the MAP WEB. If you are consulting the Walkthroughs for Chapters
5 - 9, please be aware that these pages will soon be revised drastically.
In the meantime, please consult the MAP WEB, which contains more accurate
information than the Walkthroughs. The Walkthroughs are basically sound, though.<p>

</ul>

<li><b>January 4, 1999</b><br>

<ul>
<li>New version of the Chapter 3 Walkthrough. Some minor changes in Chapter 2.<p>
</ul>

<li><b>January 1, 1999</b><br>

<ul>

<li>Have uploaded a new version of the Chapter 2 Walkthrough. There's also a Special Page
here. I also decided to do a special Grain Quest page, since this will take the player to
a very seldom visited part of Midkemia, i.e. the Western Sectors of Zone 5. Apart from that,
there's nothing new, except for a few unimportant changes related to the Chapter 1 Walkthrough.
<p>

Quick observation from the Webmaster: I've though a lot about the LINKING of
the MAP WEB and the WALKTHROUGHS (see below). I haven't changed my mind. After
re-doing Chapter 2, I'm even more certain than before, that the two can't
possibly be linked, except in the "superficial" manner I've chosen. There's
really a very simple way of utilizing the Walkthroughs in conjunction with the
Map Web: Open TWO WINDOWS in your Browser, with the Walkthrough in one, and the
relevant Sector of the Map Web in the other. I've tested, and it works fine. As
soon as the Walkthrough leads to a new Sector, switch to the Map Window and click
the proper Red Arrow.<p>

</ul>

<li><b>December 28, 1998</b><br>

<ul>

<li>No, I haven't finished Chapter 2. I've added a NINE ZONES page to the WALK
Menu, and created a SPECIAL page for players who want to travel all over the
place in Chapter 1 (including Dimwood). I realized this had to be done, as soon
as I started working on Chapter 2. Those of you familiar with the MAP WEB won't
need to be told this, but PLEASE REMEMBER that the Combat Numbers are Zone-dependent.
Combat #01 in Zone 1 is not the same as Combat #01 in Zone 2.
<p>

Webmaster observes: The most difficult aspect of revising the Walkthroughs is
that of LINKING them to the MAP WEB. I've been contemplating this for months.
The only feasible way of doing this is to link the various SECTOR MAPS to the
Walkthroughs. I've thought about linking all the Combat Pages, but this just
CAN'T BE DONE! There are 1600 of them, and the work involved in linking and
back-linking would be stupendous. And ultimately useless, I think. In order to reap
the rewards of both the Walkthroughs and the Map Web, you must be prepared to
use BOTH - there is no way to "perfectly" integrate them. They are two different
approaches, and must be kept apart. A complete integration of BOTH into ONE would
result in a HUGE and unwieldy MUDDLE.<p>

Webmaster is touched: I was overwhelmed by all the Christmas Greetings I received from
BAK Web users! Thanks to all, and a Wonderful New Year to you all!<p>

</ul>

<li><b>December 23, 1998</b><br>

<ul>

<li>Chapter One Walkthrough has been revised, updated, and LINKED to the Map
Web. This was NOT easy. All of you Nitpickers out there - please tell me what's
wrong, before I repeat my mistakes in Chapter 2!<p>

Webmaster wonders: I've received some complaints that the text colors I use are
too bright. I've also received complaints about the colors being not bright
enough! One user gets blinded, while another feels he has to turn on all the
lights in his room. I don't think this is my fault. I know, from experience,
that MONITORS can differ drastically, and there's nothing I can do about this.
All I can do is to make sure that my pages can be read on DARK Monitors. If you
have a BRIGHT Monitor, my pages may "blind" you, but I'm sure your computer has
buttons, allowing you to control the brightness and contrast.<p>

</ul>

<li><b>December 20, 1998</b><br>

<ul>

<li>New WALK WEB Page and Menu. This one was a headache, and since I only just started
revising the WALK WEB, it may change soon.<p>

<li>The Basic Walkthrough has been corrected, rewritten and redesigned, but only slightly.<p>

<li>Also corrected, and expanded the Tips & Tricks page. I attempted to classify the various
tips, but gave up. It's not easy. If I ever come up with a way, I'll do it, but for the time
being it will have to remain a linear list, with the BASIC stuff at the top, and the tips growing
more and more ADVANCED as you move down.<p>

<li>You'll notice that I have placed my two favorite SPECIAL TRICKS in the Main
WALK Menu. This is quite intentional, because both tricks can easily be performed
during the start of the game. The Broken Crossbow Trick is, I feel, the greatest
BAK Trick known to me, but I fear I've hidden it away too thoroughly, because nobody has
ever commented on it!<p>

Webmaster says: Having now updated all the "special" pages in the WALK WEB, I feel
I can finally start my most dreaded task ever - the revision of the Chapter Walkthroughs.
Some complicated solutions will be called for. I've been contemplating this for weeks, and
I do have some vague ideas. Wish me luck.<p>

</ul>


<li><b>December 17, 1998</b><br>

<ul>

<li>New Front Page (Home). If you don't like it, I guess you'll just have to get
used to it. Lots of thanks to Bob Freimuth for his suggestions.<p>

<li>The Updates Page has been split into Updates and Credits/History. As a result there
is a completely new Credits page.<p>

<li>I was about to delete the LETTERS page, because it's ancient and outdated, but when
I re-read it, it caused a surge of nostalgia. So I decided to keep it, at least for the
time being, if only to remind me of the early days. I added a few comments, where they
seemed neccessary.<p>

<li>LINKS and AWARDS slightly re-designed.<p>

Webmaster says: The revisions are coming along slowly, but nicely. The LOOK WEB is
done, except for a few SHOP WEB pages that nobody seems to miss anyway. Now that
I've re-done the front page, and the minor pages (see above), the next step will be
the WALK WEB. The basic WALK page will soon look similar to the re-designed LOOK page.
Then I'll totally rewrite the Walkthroughs, and try to find a way to inter-link them
to the MAP WEB.<p>

</ul>

<li><b>December 13, 1998</b>
<ul>
<li>LOOK page has been redesigned for easier access. No scrolling is now
needed. CHEAT CHESTS and MOREDHEL ALPHABET pages have been redesigned
and expanded slightly, deleted from the LOOK MENU, and are now accessible
from links at the top of the RIDDLES page. Hope I don't get too many
complaints about this ;-)

<li>My good friend Bob Freimuth suggested a comparative table of Initial
Statistics. I decided to try my hand at it, and the result is a totally
redesigned page. You can still click the faces, though, and view the
full-screen Stats Pages for each Character. Thanks, Bob, for one more
brilliant idea.<p>

</ul>

<li><b>December 9, 1998</b>

<ul>
<li>TEMPLES Page rewritten. New info added.<p>
</ul>

<li><b>December 5, 1998</b>

<ul>
<li>Have rewritten the RIDDLES page. Lots of people have asked for Complete
Riddles, so here they are, with a vengeance. Also rewrote the Moredhel Chests pages.
All of this took a *lot* of time. All the data was compared with the Map Web - a few
errors were detected and corrected. I tried very hard not to, but I've probably added
some new errors ... Please tell me if you spot them.
<li>Slight revision of INITIAL STATISTICS. Figured out how to do full-screen captures,
hope they don't take ages to download ...<p>
</ul>

<li><b>November 24, 1998</b>

<ul>
<li>Revised BARDING page. The 1.01/1.02 version differences have been fully
explored, and lots of new information added.
<li>Revised GRAVEYARDS Page. All Headstone texts have been included.<p>
</ul>

<li><b>November 18, 1998</b>

<ul>
<li>CHAT: Feist's novelization of the game should be in the bookstores
by now, and in the bestseller lists as well. I have both the American edition
and the European edition on order, but still haven't received them. I don't know
about the European one, but the American one is definitely accompanied by a CD-ROM
containing BAK and a demo of RTK. I'm expecting a surge of visits!
You may have noticed that I've placed a link to the American Edition (Avon) at the top
of the Front Page. You can vote for your favorite Fantasy-related Web Site. Do it now!<p>

GOOD NEWS: At last I've found a reliable COUNTER for my Front Page, one that I'm sure will stay there!
I've had at least three counters breaking down in the past. The new one is on my
own server, which is *very* reliable.<p>

<li>UPDATES: The SPELLS pages have been totally rewritten and redesigned. This was
quite a job, and the reason why nothing has happened here for a month or so. Lots of
research needed to be done, especially on the Enemy Immunities and Extra Damage. I have
received invaluable assistance from <font color=#009900>Bob Freimuth</font> while creating
these pages. Thanks, Bob, not only for your suggestions, but also for your *patience* :-)))<p>
</ul>

<li><b>October 17, 1998</b>
 
<ul>
<li>The new BOOKS & JOURNALS page is here. As before, the Books can be Clicked and Read, but I've also
redesigned the separate Book pages. Slightly.<p>
Wish me luck. I've just bought a new computer. It is *very* powerful, and so far I am in seventh heaven. I now
have access to the Internet at home, and the BOOKS Files are my very first files to be uploaded from my living
room!<p>
</ul> 

<li><b>October 16, 1998</b>

<ul>
<li>More LOOK revisions. BOOKS & NOTES have been split into BOOKS and
SPYNOTES. I still haven't revised the BOOKS section, but the SPYNOTES
have been totally rewritten. All NOTES can now be read.
<li>As a result, lots of other unimportant changes have been made. I
can't be bothered to list them here. Some are in the MAP WEB, others
in the WALKTHROUGHS, CHEAT CHESTS, RIDDLES.
<li>My next revision will be BOOKS. This won't be as time-consuming as
the SPYNOTES, so it should be here in a couple of days.
<p>
</ul>

<li><b>October 13, 1998</b>

<ul>
<li>The LOOK Menu has been simplified. All "extra" items (magical or otherwise) have 
been grouped under OTHER ITEMS, and classified accordingly.
<p>
</ul>

<li><b>October 2, 1998</b>

<ul>
<li>Thanks to Fredrik Eriksson, I am happy to offer you a new, improved version of
BaK-Hacker (8.2). Have updated the LINKS page to include some links to websites of
interest to those eagerly awaiting the November release of RETURN TO KRONDOR.
<p>
</ul>

<li><b>October 1, 1998</b>

<ul>
<li>LOOK revisions: BASICS and QUARRELS have been added to. MODIFIERS, POTIONS and KEYS
have been totally re-designed, including lots of new information.
<p>
</ul>

<li><b>September 21, 1998</b>

<ul>
<li>Some more LOOK pages have been revised and expanded: STAFFS, CROSSBOWS and QUARRELS.
Additions and Changes have also been made to recent revisions, especially MONEY. A noticable
addition to BASICS will come soon, as well as a drastic redesign of MODIFIERS.
<p>
</ul>

<li><b>September 18, 1998</b>

<ul>
<li>Some more LOOK pages have been revised and expanded: MONEY & GEMS,
SWORDS and ARMOR.
<p>
</ul>

<li><b>September 14, 1998</b>

<ul>
<li>Frankly nothing much has happened here since the last update.
I've been taking some time off to work on another (totally unrelated)
website, which will soon be finished. 
<li>I've been silently correcting some minor errors in the MAP WEB.
Thanks to <font color=#009900>Jeremy Martz (Volante)</font> for pointing most of these out to
me. Not much escapes his keen eye, and I actually think he knows this
website better than I do!
<li>I'm gathering the courage to face the most dreaded of challenges: the
revision of the LOOK and WALK pages. This will take forever, I think.
I'm too much of a coward to face the WALK pages yet, so I'll start
with the LOOK Pages. My first experiment is the BASIC NECESSITIES
Page - this is now totally different, and much expanded.
<p>
</ul>

<li><b>June 19, 1998</b>

<ul>
<li>LOOK WEB: BOOKS. I've just researched the READING of BOOKS. As a result
lots of new (and revised) info has been added to this page.

<p>
</ul>

<li><b>June 18, 1998</b>

<ul>
<li>MAP WEB: Eggley Sector has been revised to include new info on Devon.
<li>AWARDS: The BAK Help Web has received the Dragon Award.
<li>WEBMASTER'S MESSAGE: Having completed the MAP WEB, I am acutely
aware of all the errors and imperfections in the WALK WEB. The information
contained in the MAP WEB is, in all cases, more reliable than the information
in the Walkthroughs. The WALK WEB needs a thorough revision, and I will revise
it, as soon as I can find the time to do so. There are no serious errors in the
Walkthroughs, but until they have been revised, I recommend the MAP WEB for
reliable data.

<p>
</ul>

<li><b>June 9, 1998</b>

<ul>
<li>Fredrik Eriksson's BaKHacker is now available in version 8.01!
<li>Thanks to <font color=#009900>SiR Havoc</font> (aka <font color=#009900>][cepick</font>), I have added a completely
new Money-Making Scheme. This one is my all-time favourite, as should be obvious
from the<a href="crbtrick.html"> Special Page </a>I've devoted to it! For the time being,
this is the only link to the Broken Crossbow Trick Page. Until I redesign the TIPS 'N' TRICKS
page, it will remain so. (As you may have noticed, I like to tuck this kind of stuff into
obscure corners of the Web.) 

<p>
</ul>

<li><b>June 1, 1998</b>

<ul>
<li>MAP WEB ASSISTANT added. I'm not really pleased with the result, but
it will have to do. Any suggestions (especially comprehensive ones, dealing
with the structure of the page as a whole) are welcome.
<li>After subjecting the MAP WEB pages to rigorous tests, some unimportant
errors have been found, and corrected.
<li>Some changes in the Front Page in order to accommodate the MAP WEB. Other
Changes (long overdue) bring this Page up to date (I think)	.
<p>
</ul>

<li><b>May 25, 1998</b>

<ul>
<li>Some minor corrections made in the MAP WEB. Also added a link to
Neal Hallford's homepage (see LINKS page).
<p>

</ul>

<li><b>May 22, 1998</b>

<ul>
<li>The Sethanon Caverns (Upper and Lower Levels) added to the MAP WEB.
I guess that completes it, apart from the Assistant Page, which is being
worked on and will be added soon. Also revised the LaMut and Questor's
View sectors to include the Joke Quest.<p>
A small addition to the LOOK WEB: A recently discovered fact concerning
the effects of Strength Drain on Wind Elementals has been added to the
Spell description. (Thanks to Fredrik Eriksson for solving this problem.)<p>

</ul>

<li><b>May 12, 1998</b>

<ul>
<li>While taking apart the game's data files for Zone 5, I discovered
an "hexadecimal house", hitherto unfamiliar. With the help of BaKHacker, 
I was able to pinpoint its exact position, and discover a "NEW" SHOP!
It was a very pleasant moment for someone who has been investigating
BAK for as long as the Webmaster has. So now the <a href="alchemy.html">Alchemist's Shop</a> has
been added, proudly, to the Shop Pages, and the relevant pages in the
Shop Web have been updated.<p>

My pleasure soon subsided. Re-opening the Shop Web, which I guiltily haven't looked 
at for ages<br>(mainly because hardly anyone seems to be interested), I realized 
that I had loads of additions to the<br>
<a href="itmindex.html">ITEM AVAILABILITY/PRICE INDEX</a>
that I've never uploaded, for some reason or other. Gosh.<p>
And I have no idea why. Maybe
I wasn't satisfied with them at the time, although they look fine to me today.
I *did* lose interest in this project at a certain moment, and decided to
concentrate my efforts on the MAP WEB instead, but I *thought* I had uploaded
all the finished pages. Obviously I didn't, so I'm doing it now. My apologies
to those of you who have been waiting for this info. (There are not many of you
who are passionate enough about BAK to care, but your constant letters are the
fuel that keeps me going!) And maybe I'll finish the project - some day.<p>

</ul>

<li><b>May 11, 1998</b>



<ul>
<li><a href="zone5.html">ZONE 5</a> added to the Map Web, including
the related <a href="zone6e.html">Zone 6 (East)</a> and the 
<a href="diviner.html">Diviner's Hall</a>.<p>

</ul>

<li><b>April 27, 1998</b>



<ul>
<li><a href="zone4.html">ZONE 4</a> added to the Map Web.<p>

</ul>

<li><b>April 14, 1998</b>



<ul>
<li><a href="zone3.html">ZONE 3</a> is ready at last.

<li><a href="allzones.html">MAP WEB</a> link has now been added to the Front Page.<br>

I wasn't going to do this until I'd finished the dratted thing, but avalanches of
e-mail have forced me to. You'll have to wait patiently for the rest - as you can
see, it's taking me a month to do each Zone.<p>

</ul>

<li><b>March 17, 1998</b>



<ul>

<li><a href="zone7.html">ZONE 7</a> has now been added to the MAP WEB.<br>
     It was a nightmare. Thank Ishap there wasn't a dungeon involved!<p>
     As I go along, I'm working on a Main Page for the Maps, and also a
     "Map Assistant" page. Bear with me. This is *very* time-consuming, and
     I need a month's holiday in order to finish it! But as I can only work on
     the WEB after 10 PM, you will have to be (very) patient.<p>

</ul>


<li><b>February 26, 1998 (Webmaster's Birthday!)</b>



<ul>

<li> <a href="zone6.html">ZONE 6</a> has now been added to the MAP WEB.<br>

     This was not easy! I almost gave up in disgust. But here it is.<p>

</ul>



<li><b>January 29, 1998</b>



<ul>

<li> I have been working hard on the MAP WEB. I knew it would be time-consuming, but

     I was wrong. It is practically devouring all my leisure hours. I don't 

     have any time left over for seeing friends, watching television, going to the movies, 

     reading books, etc. Blast! But I've started it, so I will finish it - later rather

     than sooner. No more sighing - here's the news:<p>

     I have finished the below Zones and their related Dungeons:<p>



<a href="zone1.html">

     ZONE 1</a> (Yabon/Zun/Hawk's Hollow/TyrSog)<br>

<a href="zone2.html">

     ZONE 2</a> (Questor's View/Krondor/Tanneurs/Eggley)<br>

<a href="zone8.html">

     ZONE 8</a> (Elvandar)<br>

<a href="zone9.html">

     ZONE 9</a> (Timirianya)<p>



     I still haven't had time to create an index page for the above. And the HELP

     Page is still in the works. You can access ZONE 1 via the link above and travel all 

     the way to Krondor and Elvandar (Zones 1, 2, and 8 are interlinked). ZONE 9 is separate.<p>

     

     At the moment I'm trying to decide which Zone I will attack next. It will probably

     be ZONE 6 (Northlands). This is a challenge indeed, and I suppose I'd better do it

     before I get (very) old.<p>



</ul>



<li><b>December 18, 1997</b>



<ul>

<li> Availability/Price Index of the Shop Pages. I know I promised to finish this,

     but the mindless work involved bored me to tears. Nobody has complained yet.

     I don't think anyone has looked at the bloody thing, anyway.

<li> Many of you have pointed out errors in the Web. You're probably disgusted that

     I haven't corrected them. I grovel. I (shamelessly) can't be bothered to correct

     each minor error as soon as I become aware of it. One of these days I'll gather

     the courage, and correct ALL of them. But then I won't get any more letters :-(

<li> Thanks to <font color=#009900>Joe Proctor</font> I've just realized that some of the data in my BARDING page

     is only valid for version 1.01. I have added a note regarding this. Thanks, Joe.

<li> Other minor corrections have been done.

<li> Last, but not least. I am working on a *major* new addition to the Web. The working

     title for this is "MAP WEB". If you're curious, you are welcome to spy on me. I've

     only just started this, but you can guess at what I'm up to by going to

     <a href="zone1.html">

     www.rhi.hi.is/~eybjorn/krondor/zone1.html</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope you like it!

</ul>



<li><b>September 4, 1997</b>



<ul>

<li> Many Additions to the Availability/Price Index of the Shop Pages. I don't think

     ANYBODY is interested in this any more - although I used to get hundreds of letters asking

     for it (because it wasn't there). Now that I've finally spent hundreds of hours creating

     it, all the complainers have conveniently gone silent. (I'm going to finish it, though.)

<li> The STACKBUG Page is here, at last. Almost a year has passed since this excellent bug was

     first pointed out to me. At least 18 correspondents have reported it since, and incredibly

     they all seem to have discovered it by pure accident! Isn't this marvellous? I've managed

     to hide the STACKBUG Page at a DEEP Level. It is definitely worth the search, and

     I've included a Special Riddle! From LOOK Menu, go to SHOPS. Then BASIC PRICES.

     Then find the BUG Link. --- OK, OK, I'm being mysterious, and you want the STACKBUG Page

     NOW! Never mind - <a href="stackbug.html">here it is</a>.

</ul>



<li><b>August 20, 1997</b>



<ul>

<li> Additions to the Availability/Price Index of the Shop Pages. I will be adding

     these regularly until they're all done. From now on I can't be bothered to mention

     every little thing. When they're finished, I will definitely say so - but until

     then you'll just have to check. I've just added BOOKS and STAFFS.

<li> <b>BAK-HACKER.</b> The latest version is now 6.8 - and I'm sure there'll be more.

     The latest version number will appear on the FRONT PAGE, so from now on I won't bother

     to count this as an update. Please check the latest version number against

     the one you have - and make sure you're up to date. BaKHacker is getting better

     all the time!

</ul>



<li><b>August 17, 1997</b>



<ul>

<li> The long-promised Shop Pages are now part of the Web! At last! 

     One section is not complete yet (the Item Availability/Price Index).

     I'm hoping to finish this before I give up in frustration.

     It's a lot of work :-( [Special thanks to Jeremy Martz, whose

     help with this was invaluable. And to Bob Freimuth for his 

     observations and suggestions.]

<li> <font size=+1 color=#00ff00>BAK-HACKER!!</font> Fredrik Eriksson (of Sweden) has written a magnificent

     BAK Editor, exclusively for the BAK Help Web. BAK-Hacker is the only

     BAK Editor you'll ever need. It can do all you could ever desire it

     to do - and then some! Special features included for Hackers and

     Testers.

</ul>



<li><b>May 30, 1997</b>



<ul>

<li> Barding Page added.

<li> Comments/Credits added (see above).

</ul>



<li><b>August 1, 1996</b>

<ul>

<li>Some more changes to the Shops Pages. No more changes will be made until I have a LOT

    of time on my hands.

<li>A couple of unimportant additions to the Chapter 1 Walkthrough .

</ul>

<li><b>July 24, 1996</b>

<ul>

<li>John Pacer's RETURN TO KRONDOR FAQ is now part of the BAK Help Web.

<li>Tiny changes to the experimental Shops Pages.<br>

    Please do not write in order to tell me that the Shops Pages are difficult

    to understand! They are supposed to be! If you can't understand them, they

    are not meant for you. Just pretend they don't exist.

</ul>

<li><b>JULY 19, 1996</b>

<ul><li>Experimental Shops Page.<br><font color=#990000>

        [If you're a first-time player, this will not be of interest to you.]</font><font color=#999900>

        I really don't think I ought to make this stuff accessible, but you've been

        asking for it!

        Mostly it is extremely <b>RAW</b>, and totally without

        structure. Most of the files are text notes, waiting to

        be turned into Web Pages. It is very difficult for me to do this, 

        but I'll do it anyway. (BTW, most of the BAK Web looked like this originally!)

        When I first mentioned this possibility, I was amazed at the number

        of letters I received as a result. So here it is.

        As you may be able

        to imagine, a lot of work needs to be done in order to make all this

        information presentable! Do I hear offers of help? Would you like to

        do one of the pages?

        Anyway, here's how you access the Experimental Site. In the LOOK Menu,

        choose BOOKS & NOTES. Find STRATEGIES OF TRADING and Read it. Click on

        the pile of Gold Sovereigns, and there you are! Hope it makes sense to you ....</font>

    <li>CHAPTER 1 WALKTHROUGH - NEW LAYOUT - MANY ADDITIONS.

        Hope you like it - I've now added LINKS all over the place - also to all the

        related pages. It's been a lot of work, but the rest of the Walkthroughs will

        be easier, now that I've explored the possibilities (I hope). I can't really be

        bothered to list all the major and minor additions to this Walkthrough - to tell

        the truth, I've lost track ... One thing I'm certain of: I've deleted the TIPS

        from the beginning of this page, and made them part of my new ...

    <li>TIPS AND TRICKS PAGE!<br>

        Unfortunately this page is in its experimental stages, as yet. You can find

        many other Tips'n'Tricks, not included here, in the Walkthroughs and the Letters.

        And I'm not saying a word about my huge backlog of letters,

        which I still haven't had time to add to the Correspondence Page. (Many of these

        letters contain suggestions crying out to be included in the BAK Web, but when will

        I ever find the time? I will, though.) Please feel free to suggest any Tips (minor or

        major) you think I should include here.

    <li>SARTH LIBRARY Page [NEW]<br>

        I knew there were books here. There are more than I thought. This one I

        discovered through pure coincidence.

    <li>CHAPTER 9 - Fighting Makala and the Dreads: Two links added, one showing

        statistics, the other illustrating the GAMBIT trick.

</ul>

<li><b>JULY 11, 1996 (corrections thanks to Jay Sevara)</b>

<ul><li>Chapter 4: Map of Eastern Sector of Sar-Sargoth Dungeon (Lower Level).<br>

        Netscape 2.0+ made this Map disappear. Should be OK now.

    <li>James' Initial Statistics corrected.

    <li>Chapter 7: Contents of Phillip's House amended.

    <li>Correspondence: A couple of errors corrected. Eliaem's Shell bug explained.

    <li>Potions: Minor correction.

    <li>Basic Necessities: Minor Correction.

    <li>Magical Items: Info on Weedwalkers and Idol of Lassur corrected.

    <li>Modifiers: Some info and statistics have been corrected.

    <li>Spells: Quite a lot of errors corrected throughout.

    <li>MESSAGE TO CONSTANT READERS:<br><font color=#999900>

        Since the last update, I haven't had a lot of opportunites to work

        on the Web. The above changes are minor (but important). You will

        have to be patient. In the future (as soon as I can) you can expect

        the following changes:

        <ul><li>The experimental Shop Page I've been promising.

            <li>Layout changes in all the Walkthroughs.

            <li>Additions to the Walkthroughs.

            <li>A new Tips 'n' Tricks Page.

        </ul></font>

</ul>

<li><b>JUNE 21, 1996</b>

<ul><li>Moredhel Chests retouch. "H" finished. "I" almost finished.

    <li>GAMES DOMAIN link added on Links Page.

    <li>Minor (& Major) visual changes to Basic LOOK Pages.

    <li>A MESSAGE TO CONSTANT READERS:<br><font color=#999900>

        You may, or may not, have noticed the various visual changes

        in the Web. Please tell me if you dislike them. FYI, I have only,

        as yet, fiddled with the LOOK Section. Soon I will upload a new

        version of the Chapter 1 Walkthrough, and all related pages.</font>

    <li>SHOPS PAGE.<br><font color=#999900> I wish I'd never mentioned it! But all the letters

        asking about it have convinced me that it has to be done. I have all

        the data - but I don't have the time to create it! Please bear with

        me? I'm working on this, whenever I can, but it is a HUGE project.

        Soon I will be in a position to upload some raw, experimental pages.

        They will NOT be included in the BAK Help Web proper, but if you're

        interested, I can tell you what the URL is. Just remember that those

        pages will be experimental, "work in progress", for your eyes only.

        I still have no idea how I'm going to lay out the larger ones, - it's

        a real headache. I'm hoping to get feedback ideas from YOU.</font>

</ul>

<li><b>JUNE 6, 1996</b>

<ul><li>Lots of LINKS added throughout the LOOK Section and related pages.<br>

        Basically all LOOK Links are now in place - excepting all the Moredhel<br>

        Chest Pages, where I've only done the letter A (yet).<br>


    <li>As a result all LOOK Pages have changed (visually).<br>

        The basic contents of some LOOK Pages have been altered and updated.

    <li>For example, the TEMPLES Page has been drastically re-designed.

    <li>A similar overhaul of the WALK Pages will follow (soon, I hope).
