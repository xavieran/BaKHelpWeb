They were not alone.<p>

James's pulse quickened as he saw the lone figure approach; but when it became apparent they 
were not being attacked, he relaxed a bit, squinted slightly in an attempt to see who was 
about to join them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARTIN:</font>
I knew when I saw Seigneur Locklear prowling about with Baron Gabot you couldn't be far behind. 
How's my princely bother Arutha?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Fine, when I last saw him. He's outside of the Dimwood with a small force, waiting for my 
messengers to reach him. What are you doing so far from Crydee anyway? Briana have you hunting 
rabbits for the ducal stew?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARTIN:</font>
No, but soon we four will be hunting far larger game than that. Seems this small wrinkle 
developing in the Northlands is about to become a Kingdom problem if what Locklear told me was 
correct. I'm just glad to have you two here to lend a hand.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Is King Lyam going to join the party?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARTIN:</font>
Doubtful. This engagement isn't serious enough to warrant bringing the King into it and he's got
his hands full enough with the Keshian Empire. Seems one of our Kingdom ships accidentally 
mistook one of her Empress' Imperial frigates as a pirate ship and sunk it with all hands on 
board. Naturally, Lord Hazra-Khan is having a conniption. We'll have to fight out Northwarden's 
battle on our own.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
What can Locklear and I do?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARTIN:</font>
I have most of Baron Gabot's rangers out checking up on the movements of the enemy, so I'll need
you three to give me a hand with various missions. I hope you three are in the mood for a bit of
running about...<p>

Prince Arutha has told me on several occasions you're about the finest archer he knows.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARTIN:</font>
Arutha also used to tell his sister Carline that his father was going to rope her to the 
mainmast of Krondor's Glory so the Quegians could have target practice when they passed her 
in the harbor. Doesn't mean it was true.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
And I wasn't Jimmy the Hand. You're being modest, Duke.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARTIN:</font>
So I might be handy with a bow, why the interest?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I was hoping you could give Locky and I a few pointers. We both could stand to learn a little 
about how to use the crossbow more effectively.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARTIN:</font>
Well, as the moredhel don't seem to be charging down our throats this very minute, I suppose I 
might be able to teach you a little bit...<p>

Martin sighted his crossbow and fired.<p>

Feathers drifted from above as the lifeless sparrow crashed through the branches to the ground, 
a crossbow quarrel neatly driven through it's head. It had been dead even before it touched the 
ground.<p>

"That's incredible," James said. "At that range I would have thought it impossible."<p>

"No," Martin said, his look somewhat enigmatic as he knelt to touch the bird at his feet. "I've 
hit them at twice that distance, so it was merely difficult." Handing his crossbow over first to
James and then to Locklear, he gave instructions as each attempted similar shots.<p>

"You both have made some progress," Martin said. "Just keep doing what you started doing today 
and you'll both make fine marksmen."<p>

So... Baron Gabot told us we were to report to you until the siege begins. Where do you want us?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARTIN:</font>
I was just planning a little fun. Patrus, how's your moredhel?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PATRUS:</font>
Which 'un you talkin' about, Duke? The one I gots under my bed or the one what makes me 
breakfast in the morning?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARTIN:</font>
Amazing. Jimmy, is it just me or does Patrus remind you of a certain Admiral we both know?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I think he and Amos Trask would either love each other or hang one another from a gibbet.<p>

I think the Duke meant, how well do you speak moredhel, Patrus?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PATRUS:</font>
I knew perfect well what he was a'sayin' you court rat. I can read it, but don't ask me to 
pronounce any that dog-howlin' yewhaw.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARTIN:</font>
You won't have to for what I have in mind. There are some boxes near here that have moredhel 
plates on them. I want you to crack the codes on them. I imagine those boxes will have supplies 
of rations for the moredhel once they begin the siege, but I doubt they'll suspect we've 
tampered with them. If there are any rations, find a way to poison them, then replace them in 
the boxes. Come back and find me once you're done.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
We've poisoned the food in all the moredhel lockchests we could find. There weren't many of them
out there.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARTIN:</font>
You probably found the majority of them, so I wouldn't worry about it. I have something else I 
need you to do... There was a minstrel that the Baron employed here at Northwarden by the name 
of Tamney. When we got word that the moredhel were beginning to move down from Raglam to 
Northwarden Pass, he picked up all his things and disappeared in the middle of the night. The 
baron is insistent he brought back.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
The Baron mentioned this Tamney to us as well, but why is it so imperative he come back? Surely,
the men might feel a little betrayed, but if their morale is that shaky...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARTIN:</font>
The Baron sent word a short while ago that a Nighthawk was discovered within the confines of the
castle this morning and there is evidence there may be others. Naturally word has spread and the 
men are edgy about the whole matter. It doesn't help matters Tamney was never administered an 
oath of loyalty.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
And it's possible he was connected with the Nighthawks. I understand.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARTIN:</font>
Find him and get him back to Northwarden if you can, but don't let him know you're suspicious. 
He might bolt... One of Gabot's scouts has told me there may be goblin activity in the north, so
hurry back when you're finished. I may need your help.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I'm beginning to get wistful for the days when we were running the billets in Krondor for Master
deLacy. I haven't had this much exercise in a long time... So, where are these goblins you told 
us about?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARTIN:</font>
What about Tamney? Did you find him?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Yes, though it took a little extra work to get him heading back to Northwarden. He promised 
dutifully he would return and I believe he will. We had a long talk...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARTIN:</font>
I can see now why Arutha values you so much. I personally wouldn't have believed it possible. 
But, as things stand, we still have a long row to hoe, as they say. A goblin company of archers 
has already moved into the pass and is trying to entrench itself there. If they get a foothold, 
they may be impossible to root out once the moredhel roll in. We need to find out what their 
deployment is going to be when the battle begins.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Okay, so we grab their leader and give him the hot poker treatment in the dungeon under 
Northwarden. Tell us where to find him and he's yours.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARTIN:</font>
No good. As soon as they discover he's missing, they'll change their tactics. No, what I need 
is the big plan and I'll be willing to bet that it's still in Raglam.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
How many scouts has the Baron lent you?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARTIN:</font>
I have about twenty men out at the moment. Why?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Then you won't miss the three of us much. We're going to Raglam and we'll find a way to get that
plan for you.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARTIN:</font>
You plan to march through a company of goblin archers to the city where the moredhel are massing, 
walk right up to leader of the enemy and say, <i>Excuse me, may I just borrow your warplans,
please?</i><p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
As I recall, I snuck the future Duke of Crydee, Prince and Princess, and the Admiral of the 
Western Fleet out of Krondor while it was under siege of Jocko Radburn and Guy du Bas-Tyra. I 
think I can snatch a silly piece of paper.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I think if Prince Arutha didn't want to make you the Duke of Krondor some day, he would probably
have you killed as a madman. All right then, get me that paper but be careful. I'll be waiting 
for you...<p>

We got the plans for you, Martin. Too bad you didn't come with us though, we had quite a bit of 
fun.<p>

Won't be much time for that very soon. My gut instinct tells me they'll begin the assault in 
the next few days. Before we go back to the castle, there's something I would like you three to 
check out for me. I got this mysterious note from someone that said a company of moredhel 
illusionists have slipped behind Northwarden. I thought Patrus would know how best to deal with 
them...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PATRUS:</font>
Just like those pointy eared lily munchers to go stealin' my ideas! Baron Gabot had me workin'

some reason... But if we run across them, I got sumthin' that'll fix their hindquarters in a 
bat's fart!<p>

James's pulse quickened as he saw the lone figure approach; but when it became apparent they 
were not being attacked, he relaxed a bit, squinted slightly in an attempt to see who was about 
to join them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARTIN:</font>
James! Locklear! What are you doing here?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Prince Arutha told us that a Tsurani magician has given over a rift machine to the moredhel for 
use in this battle. We've come down here to locate and destroy it before Delekhan can get full 
use of it. How did you get here? We never saw you at the castle.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARTIN:</font>
When a portion of the Southern Arrow company began to fall back from Northwarden, I decided to 
follow after them and make sure they weren't up to any mischief. As you might have guessed, they
had that infernal machine of theirs set up a few miles to the north, but they spotted me and 
assumed that I was a human mercenary that was slacking behind...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
...so you played along and went through the gate and ended up here. How did you know you
wouldn't end up in Sar-Sargoth?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARTIN:</font>
I didn't, but I was surrounded by moredhel. I imagined that my best hope for survival lay on 
the other side of wherever that door led. Whenever we emerged here, I told the captain that I 
had to rejoin my unit and I was off. There were a few close moments along the way, but I won 
free at last.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Why didn't you try to destroy it?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARTIN:</font>
I thought about it, but the device was surrounded by moredhel at the time so I decided I'd try 
to gather some help. You three are the first humans I've seen in a week.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Relative to where we are now, where is the rift-machine? Is it nearby?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARTIN:</font>
I'm not sure. To escape the moredhel camp, I slipped under a stack of canvas bags in the back of
a supply wagon they brought with them. After we had travelled for a few hours, they pulled over 
for a nature break and I was able to get away. I do recall hearing water as we were moving out, 
however.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
So you were near a waterfall or a river... At least that gives us an idea of where we can start 
our search. Anything else we should know?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARTIN:</font>
From listening to the wagon drivers talk, I get the feeling I wasn't the only unexpected visitor
through that machine of theirs. Apparently some rebel moredhel chieftain came through and caused
them a good deal of grief, then headed south towards where one of their warlords is staging for 
the attack on Sethanon. They were none too happy about him being on the loose. I'm hoping I can 
find him myself so I can ask him a few questions.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Any idea who this warlord in the south is?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARTIN:</font>
I believe it's Delekhan's son Moraeulf, though I couldn't be certain of it. They were bandying 
about names so fast, I was having a little trouble understanding all of it. My moredhel isn't 
all it used to be.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
What is it with Sethanon and the moredhel? This is the second time they've attacked there and I 
never understood why they struck ten years ago. There's nothing in Sethanon but a heap of ruins.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
At least the last time we had an army to get in their way. Even at a forced march, Prince
Arutha's men can't get here for another few days and they'll be exhausted once they arrive
and...now that I think of it, why is Delekhan bringing an army? If he expected to arrive at 
Sethanon behind our lines, he could simply walk in, take what he wants, then turn around and 
walk through that rift-gate without a scratch unless he expected someone else to be there!
Who does he think will be at Sethanon? What does it mean?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARTIN:</font>
It means they didn't get what they came for the last time they raided. It also means Delekhan 
has been watching Sethanon for quite some time, possibly as long as the end of the last battle. 
He knows Squire Phillip's men will be in the way.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Squire Phillip's men? What would a squire be doing leading a counter-attack?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARTIN:</font>
It would take me too long to explain it to you at the moment. Suffice to say, I don't think 
Delekhan and his men will be having a good day once they get to Sethanon. If we're lucky, they 
will be deterred long enough for Arutha to start nibbling away at their flanks.<p>

The one major advantage I can see in our favor is that we and the moredhel are at equal

some of theirs out so they can retreat to the Northlands when the time comes.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARTIN:</font>
If they intend on retreating. They didn't seem to be too interested in it the last time they 
came. A bit of advice though. If you come across any food, I'd suggest holding on to it. We've 
found several of their food caches and poisoned them as we did at Northwarden, and with two 
armies marching through here at the same time, I imagine food is about to get scarce. As 
unpleasant an option as it may seem, you may have to resort to taking food off dead moredhel.<p>
