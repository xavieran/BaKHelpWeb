"People did not understand my magical talents so I moved to the Dimwood to live out my final
days in restful solitude. I just wanted to be left alone."<p>

way believed you responsible for his trapping miseries."<p>

The woman looked glum. "Such a simple man. Men like that often fear what they do not understand.
I suppose I should've been more tolerant but when he killed some of my livestock and poisoned my

Moving out of the way, he tipped it over, spilling the poisonous contents to the ground, then
watched the water as it trailed down the side of a small hill in tiny rivers, forming tributaries
and islets in the dust.<p>

A discouraged look set upon his face like a dark shadow, but then it just as quickly lifted. He 
tipped up the bucket and began to fish around inside. When he at last removed his hand he held a
small red berry between his thumb and forefinger... "Silverthorn," he said.

darkness of the watery hole...<p>

Let's hope that works. I pray to Ishap the water in this well hasn't already claimed the lives
of the owners. I suspect they will be pretty grateful for what we've just done.

James struggled.<p>

The ground was well suited for travelling, but he felt less suited to make the journey out of
the cove than he did when he entered.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I don't feel well. I don't know what happened to us back there, but I feel as if I've walked
a thousand miles today.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES+ (if Craig):</font>
I can understand a little better how that old fellow Craig said he wasn't half as old as he
looked.  It's as if there were something feeding on us back there. It's a good thing we weren't
there as long as he was.<p>

The puzzle worried him.<p>

Though they had escaped alive, he still was bothered by the presence of the Pantathians in the
area. He had no liking for the serpent folk, and their presence in the Kingdom so near the
battle sight of Sethanon unnerved James a good deal.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
What do you think the Pantathians were after, Owyn? Do you think they were rooting around
looking for something?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
With the Pantathians, who can tell? No one in the Kingdom knows exactly what they want, but
they seem to get mixed up in nearly everything that's got a bad ending. My guess is that they
were trying to channel the strength they were stealing into something else. Maybe they needed
power for a spell.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I am none to comfortable with the thought of that. I felt their powers when we entered the area,
though I didn't know what it was I perceived.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES+ (if Craig):</font>
At least we have come out of there none the worse for the wear. I imagine that Craig is beyond
help. It is a good thing we didn't remain a month, as he did.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Well, I don't know about you, but I feel almost normal again. I for one am glad the whole
affair is over.
