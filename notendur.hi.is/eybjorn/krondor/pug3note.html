<h2>PUG'S THIRD NOTE</h2></center><hr>
<blockquote><font size=+1><b>
Tomas:<p>
I have discovered two things of interest which may be of help.
First, as I have mentioned in my previous missive, the manna has
been crystallized on this world and may be harvested in bounty 
from the yellow crystal formations which dot the planet. My second
discovery was an artifact of a surprisingly high order which I was
able to free from a magical trap near the columns to the north. I
suspect by various elements of its design that it is meant to enhance
certain telepathic abilities, and will attempt this evening to see if
it might be utilized in reaching Gamina's mind. More later.<p>
Pug of Stardock
