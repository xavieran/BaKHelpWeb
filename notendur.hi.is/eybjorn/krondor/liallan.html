They were not alone.<p>

Owyn's pulse quickened as he saw the lone figure approach; but when it became apparent they were
not being attacked, he relaxed a bit, squinted slightly in an attempt to see who was about to 
join them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LIALLAN:</font>
I was beginning to believe Delekhan had slain you. He will be infuriated that you escaped.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
You sound imminently pleased at that prospect. Why this charade, Liallan? You can't believe in 
Delekhan's activities any more than I, and yet you support his cause. You command a respectable 
tribe and have almost as much power.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LIALLAN:</font>
Almost? Do you forget who engineered your escape from Sar-Sargoth all those months ago? Who do 
you think directed Delekhan's rats into the snowplains while Obkhar's family scrambled to safety.
That was my doing. If not for my help, the Six would surely have crushed your tribes from the 
Green Heart.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Were you responsible for...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LIALLAN:</font>
...No, I had nothing to do with your escape this time. Whatever you may have done, you have 
achieved on your own. Your first escape served my purposes, but your continued survival is as 
nothing to me. It neither threatens or advances my cause.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Then you will help me again?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LIALLAN:</font>
I will consider my efforts an investment against the future of the Northlands, Gorath. They 
will gain me little now, but perhaps at a later day your help may be useful. I will alert my 
spies to whatever your needs may be. To be honest, I don't believe you will achieve much beyond 
your own survival, but even that may prove to be my boon.<p>

You consort with a monster, Liallan. Tell us a way and we shall murder him in his sleep. Show us
a secret passage and we shall drink his blood and buy the moredhel out of their pact of blood.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LIALLAN:</font>
And what shall become of us? Moraeulf will then step into his father's place and use our 
treachery to light the fires under our pursuers. Delekhan must fight this battle and our kin 
die with him on foreign soil for futile cause. Only then will the other clans who wait to join 
him know that we cannot unify under a banner of death.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Their failure taught them no lesson after Murmandamus betrayed us in the field and this shall 
come to no new conclusion!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LIALLAN:</font>
We want the same things, Gorath, though I intend to claim what you fear. I will take the throne 
of the Nations of the North when Delekhan has fallen to Kingdom blades. I will lead...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
...I don't know whether I should laugh or weep at that suggestion, Liallan, but I favor you 
over his bastard get Moraeulf.<p>

There have been few occasions I have had to visit Nalar's Rib. I forget its location.<p>

It lies south of here, as the crow flies, a few minutes from the front gates of Sar-Sargoth. I

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Again, I must seek help in the Kingdom. Prince Arutha's army must be there to meet Delekhan.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LIALLAN:</font>
It may prove more difficult than you imagine. Delekhan has called for Narab's head.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Why should that be? If not for Narab, I would still be loose in the Kingdom...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LIALLAN:</font>
I do not know what fires burn in his mind, but they smoke like madness to me. Narab has called 
on his clan to surround us, though they can be little threat to us here. The Six will crush 
them hopelessly, but they can restrict us for a time.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
The more that Narab plays the fool, the more time it will gain us, though I could wish he were 
doing it elsewhere. Is there no way past his clan?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LIALLAN:</font>
Not unless you may know how to bring down the dark god's wrath from Nalar's Rib, I can't imagine
a way until the Six arrive.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
For what goal does Delekhan do this? There can be nothing gained by attacking a single castle 
on the frontier of the Kingdom.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LIALLAN:</font>
He tells those who rally to him that Murmandamus lives, that he is captive within the Kingdom 
and that he intends to free him from captivity. None saw him die at Sethanon.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
And what advantage is there in that for Delekhan? Step aside and let Murmandamus retake his 
place on the throne? I would easier believe you the mistress of death than Delekhan one who 
longs for his ancient master.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LIALLAN:</font>
It would seem then there is one among the moredhel who thinks. I too have wondered at what he 
wishes to gain and I may only conclude he plots to get something from Murmandamus in exchange 
for freeing him. He had great powers, greater even than the Six who now work for Delekhan. 
Perhaps he believes he can learn the secrets of our former leader's powers.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Whence did Delekhan's magicians come? They were spoken of in Harlech before first I left the 
Northlands. Do they advise?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LIALLAN:</font>
And more. They plan great schemes into the night with him, meetings to which even I am no longer
privy. They are the ones who recommended the extermination of your tribe. They speak of the low 
born as if their lives are without value. It is as if they live for the complexities of intrigue.
Little else seems to matter to them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
When they buy their wine, with what coins do they bargain?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LIALLAN:</font>
None. They carry only gems, rubies of low quality. They toss them about as if they were as 
common as seeds.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
They abide in Sar-Sargoth?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LIALLAN:</font>
When they are with Delekhan. At the moment they have gone south with Moraeulf to Harlech. I 
believe they mean to round up others of your tribe who have been reluctant to join Delekhan's 
throng.<p>
