<blockquote><blockquote><font size=+1>
A journal of an unknown dwarf, the majority of the pages in the book were
concerned with a creature which the author referred to alternately as a
Braek Nuir, Braak Noor, and Brak Nurr. Some mention was also made about a
secret chamber in the lower chambers of the Mac Mordain Cadal which once had been
occupied by someone named Rhuargh.
