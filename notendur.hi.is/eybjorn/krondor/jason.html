The boy walked over to join them. He stood before them, eyes downcast.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JASON:</font>
Are you...the Collectors?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
The Collectors? What do you know about them?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JASON:</font>
Only what master Carolus said. Before he went away he says to me that one day the Collectors
would come and take me away to a pretty place where every boy would be like me and I wouldn't 
have to worry and that I shouldn't be upset he had to go 'cause he was going to a real nice 
place where people were like him. I tried to not be scared but it was real hard and after the 
master left I cried real hard for days until my head hurt. Then one day the Black Sheep man 
found me and said I could scrub his pots until the Collectors take me.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
And how much does your current master pay you?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JASON:</font>
Pay me?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Yes, your wages - What does the Black Sheep man give you for helping clean up around here, for 
sweeping the floor and scrubbing pots?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JASON:</font>
Oh, well he's very good to me, Lord. He lets me sleep in the coup with the chickens so I don't 
catch the shakes and I get the bread that hasn't greened yet.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
That's...very kind of him. Is he here?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JASON:</font>
No. He left a week ago on business to Silden. He said he would be back very soon and that I 
could sleep here in the shop. I forgot to lock the door.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Well, we'll leave you then. I want you to lock up the shop behind us and I want you to stay
here until your master comes back. When he does, I want you to tell him that the Collectors are 
coming for him very soon and that Seigneur Locklear of Prince Arutha's court says so.<p>

James motioned to the figure across the room.<p>

The boy walked over to join them. He stood before them, eyes downcast.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JASON:</font>
Are...are you going to take me away?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Why should we want to do that?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JASON:</font>
Because when I broke things, master always told me that someone would come and take me away
someplace bad and someplace dark where they would never feed me and I'd never see the light of 
day. I knew when all those people got killed in here that someone would come for me and take me 
to the bad place.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
You don't have anything to be afraid of, Jason. You didn't kill those men. It's not your fault.<p> 

<font color=#ffcc00>JASON:</font>
Master says anybody that stays under our roof is our respont...respono...responsibility and I 
was here when they were killed! That means it was my fault.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Then you saw the murders?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JASON:</font>
No, but they come in and told me to leave or they'd hurt me real bad. They didn't tell me what 
they were going to do.<p> 

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
What did the men who told you to leave look like?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JASON:</font>
They were big and they had birds on their chests, like eagles. And they smelled funny, like 
sometimes the sailors from Kesh smell like. Like flowers...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Hawks on their chests. That at least confirms the Nighthawks' involvement... Do you know any 
thing about a spider made of silver or a brass spyglass that one of the men that were killed 
might have carried? It's very important. Think hard...<p> 

<font color=#ffcc00>JASON:</font>
I...I don't know anything about the spider, but I remember that one of the King's Men had a 
brass tube with little pieces of glass in the ends of it and I could see things that were far 
away with it. He said that he and one of the other men had brought it back from Silden.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Did he say where in Silden he got it?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JASON:</font>
No...just in Silden.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Can you think of anything else? Did anyone else come into the Black Sheep before the murderers?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JASON:</font>
A carrying man brought in some wine from the Upside Down Keg for the soldiers. Told me it was 
sent special, but besides that, I can't think of anything.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Thanks, Jason. We may be back later to ask you more questions, so don't go anywhere.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JASON:</font>
Hello. Are you going to ask me more questions now?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Have you heard anything more about the murder?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JASON:</font>
Only that my master says that it will be bad for business and we have to bump bunnies to bring 
the people back in.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Bump bunnies? That's a new expression for the books. Well, we are here and I suppose we ought to
do what we can for the locals. Have anything to eat around here?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JASON:</font>
Nothing fresh, but we have standard rations if you have the money.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JASON:</font>
Is there something I can get for you?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Hello, Jason. How's your business been doing? I know you were concerned about customers coming 
back the last time I saw you.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JASON:</font>
Master is mad and says he will have to close up the shop and get rid of me because everybody is 
scared in Romney. No business.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
What are they scared of?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JASON:</font>
I don't know, but master says they are scared and he's got no use for a stupid boy when he can't
pay his debts. I guess he's right though, cause I am stupid and I'm costing him money.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
I'm...really sorry to hear about that Jason. I wish there was something we could do.<p>

Maybe if you bought some food it would help.<p>
