They were not alone.<p>

Owyn's pulse quickened as he saw the lone figure approach; but when it became apparent they
were not being attacked, he relaxed a bit, squinted slightly in an attempt to see who was about
to join them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KAT:</font>
You're not Mockers! Who...where did you come from?!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Above, from the palace. From Krondor.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KAT:</font>
From above? Then you are one of Pug's students? He sent you down to help us?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
No.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KAT:</font>
I don't understand. Why are you here?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
We believe that Duke Pug knows of magicians who are living in the sewers under Krondor and we 
need to speak to them about something. Would you know anything about them?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KAT:</font>
I have no time for this. I have something that I have to find and the Mockers are making a 
thorough search of the sewers. If they find me, I'll be floating in the harbor at dawn.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
The Mockers may be looking for you, but they aren't looking for us. If we find what you're 
looking for, we might be able to prevent your death. In exchange you answer a few questions 
for us and in half an hour you can be on the road to Sarth or Malac's Cross or wherever you 
want to go...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KAT:</font>
How do I know you won't have the Thieves' Guild lying in wait for me?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
You don't, but as you've said, without our help you're already as good as dead. As I see it, at 
least we can give you an option that doesn't end in a grave. Let's help each other - tell me 
what you're looking for...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KAT:</font>
A bronze statue, I believe it's called the Idol of Lassur. The Crawler heard a legend from a 
Keshian years ago about this object - it's the initial reason that he started looking for 
magicians to aid him - and it's reputed to endow its owner with the power over health. The 
legend has it that the idol was aboard a ship that went down near Krondor, but the Crawler 
believes that it made it to dry land and was eventually buried here when this city was Keshian.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
And if we bring you this statue, you will tell us what we need to know?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KAT:</font>
My word. Anything you need to know.<p>

They were not alone.<p>

Owyn's pulse quickened as he saw the lone figure approach; but when it became apparent they were
not being attacked, he relaxed a bit. The woman made her way across the wooden floor until she 
was standing before them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KAT:</font>
I can hear the Mockers getting closer. Have you found the Idol of Lassur for me?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Aren't you concerned that the Crawler will abuse the Idol? With it he might kill hundreds of 
people, the Prince or maybe even the King. Are you sure you want to give it to him?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KAT:</font>
I'm counting on his using it. You see, he didn't learn everything there is to know about the 
Idol. The Idol of Lassur does give its owner the power over life, but none on Midkemia can be 
its true owner - Lassur is it's owner and that is but another Isalani name for Lims-Kragma, the 
Goddess of Death. For any else that lay claim to it, they die within the month.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
I thought you worked for the Crawler!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KAT:</font>
No one works for the Crawler. What men surround him do so out of fear or debt, but none for 
loyalties' sake! I intend to put his plans to ruin, but we don't have time to talk about that.
To the matter of our deal. What do you need to know?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Who leads the Crawler's magicians?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KAT:</font>
I'm not certain, but I believe it's the Abbot Graves in Malac's Cross. He was known as an 
exceptional scribe once, and he was trusted with books coming from Stardock until Pug discovered
what was happening.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
So the Abbot would have been trusted with transcribing books on magic?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KAT:</font>
All sorts of books. He's the one that found out the Idol of Lassur's true nature and relayed the
information to me.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
I think you've told me what I needed to know. Thank you and I hope you...I wish you well...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KAT:</font>
It always boils down to lesser evils, doesn't it. Perhaps some day our choices won't be so grim.<p>
Goodbye boy, and good luck to you as well.<p>

Owyn motioned to the figure across the chamber.<p>

The woman nodded, then made her way across the wooden floor until she was standing before them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KAT:</font>
Three times in the last hour, I've heard the tramp of Mocker feet. Where is the idol?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
We haven't located it yet. You need to give us time.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KAT:</font>
I have no time to give you! I'm alive only thanks to the wits that the Crawler gave to me.
Find the idol or our deal is off.<p>
