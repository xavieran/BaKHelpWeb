<font color=#ffcc00>ORACLE:</font>
Greetings, Owyn.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Wha?!... Where am I?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ORACLE:</font>
While your body is lying, safe, still and silent in a cove near Malac's Cross, your mind has 
journeyed elsewhere...here... Your arrival has been expected. I am pleased to have you as my 
honored guest, Owyn Beleforte of Tiburn.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Me?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ORACLE:</font>
At journey's end you shall not be as you are nor may you turn back the way you have come. The 
times ahead of you will be filled with hardship and many times you will believe yourself far 
less significant than you truly are. In the days to come, you may stand at a critical juncture 
between Rythar and Mythar and if that comes to pass you should know this: A time comes for all 
things to die...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
What does that mean? Who are Rythar and Mythar?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ORACLE:</font>
I can explain in no measure more as you yet understand your world. In years and in wisdom you 
will come to me again and a great destiny will be upon you by then. You will be ready for the 
fullness of truth on that distant day. Until such time, you may consult me on other matters.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Tales say that dragons know their own destinies, but I had not heard that they knew the destinies 
of others.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ORACLE:</font>
I am no dragon though I wear a dragon's skin. I am the Oracle of the Aal and I am the last of 
my race. I am ancient, older than dwarf or elf, older than dragons and older than the Valheru 
who were their masters. Stars that at my birth flamed with violent power have long grown cold, 
expired. All these things I have seen and farther yet I see into the things that might be.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
You can see the future?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ORACLE:</font>
I can glimpse things that may be. Such was the gift given to all those of my race.<p>

A moredhel travels with us named Gorath. Is he what he says he is? Can we trust him?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ORACLE:</font>
He is not what he names himself to be, though even he may not know the lie of his heart. He will
be a strong ally unto you and I believe he may even be a champion to the kin who now curse his 
name. A great destiny awaits him should he have the courage to renounce his pain.<p>

Gorath has told us of a moredhel leader, Delekhan. Will he cross the Teeth of the World and 
attack the Kingdom?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ORACLE:</font>
Delekhan will never cross the boundary between the Kingdom and the Northlands, but through 
treachery he will strike a blow against both the Kingdom and his own Nations of the North.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Can't you be more specific? Where is he going to strike? What is the nature of this treachery?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ORACLE:</font>
I do not see futures as you imagine, but futures as they perhaps can be. I know only that 
Delekhan engineers a deceit with six magicians and that it concerns the fate of the Kingdom.<p>

How may we put a ghost to rest? A girl nearby is being terrorized by one and I was hoping

He who has been disturbed must be laid once again to rest in Jared's grave. Seek his hand in 
Lyton and commend it to the earth of Sethanon's honored dead. Then shall her terrors be brought 
to an end.<p>

A murder took place in Romney and we are seeking the murderer. We need his name.<p>

Though you believe you seek a name, it is not what you truly wish to know. As you have surmised,
the two objects which you discovered are clues to murders, though one indicates a murder you may
not have realized has taken place.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>

I don't understand. You mean what we are looking for is alive?<p>

Go you to the Abbey of Ishap at Sarth and find the knowledge held within the vaults. Your answers

Pug has been betrayed by one he believed to be a friend. Even now, he wanders a distant world 
in search of his daughter, Gamina, but he will not find her. In his search, he will reawaken 
forces sleeping since the Valheru waged their wars across the universe. The Book of Macros will 
be that instrument by which you are able to save him.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
But how can I be of any help? If he can't protect himself, there is little Gorath and I can do.<p>

Where he falters, you will grow strong. The way has been prepared for you.<p>
