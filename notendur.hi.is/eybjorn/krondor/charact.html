<a name=loc>
<center><font size=+3 color=#00cccc>LOCKLEAR</font></center>

<img src="lockface.gif" width=94 height=122 align=left hspace=20><p>

Son of the Baron of Land's End, Locklear has achieved great notoriety while 
serving Arutha con Doin, Prince of Krondor. Decorated for his service at the 
battles of Armengar and Sethanon during the war known as the Great Rising, he is 
one of the most honored nobles at the court of Krondor and in many respects is 
considered an unofficial member of the royal family.<p>

In the ninth year of the reign of King Lyam I, Locklear entered the service of a 
northern Kingdom garrison to investigate reports of a conflict raging in the 
Northlands. Shortly after his arrival, his military escort was attacked by 
moredhel raiders and Locklear found himself cut off from his companions. Later, 
upon seeing someone fleeing a moredhel warrior, Locklear slew the aggressor only 
to discover the man he had saved was in fact a moredhel himself, Gorath of the 
Ardanien Clan.<p>
<a name=gor>
<center><font size=+3 color=#00cccc>GORATH</font></center>

<img src="goraface.gif" width=94 height=122 align=left hspace=20><p>

Although he is an eligible claimant to the moredhel throne in Sar-Sargoth, 
Gorath has never desired to meddle in the politics of the Northlands, but often 
he has had little choice. He has been notably vocal in his criticism of the 
leadership of Delekhan, a moredhel who distinguished himself during the Great 
Rising as one of Murmandamus' field generals and later claimed the throne of 
Sar-Sargoth for his own.<p>

Gorath himself has led an impressive military career and during the Riftwar, he 
directed one of the only moredhel defensives to successfully withstand Tsurani 
aggression. As he beat back invaders, thousands of moredhel escaped their homes 
in the Green Heart forest to the safety offered by the Northlands. Only 
starvation and superior Tsurani numbers eventually drove Gorath and his tribe of 
the Ardanien to flee across the Great Northern Mountains to their waiting 
cousins.<p>
<a name=owy>
<center><font size=+3 color=#00cccc>OWYN</font></center>

<img src="owynface.gif" width=94 height=122 align=left hspace=20><p>

More often than not, Owyn Beleforte has been a political embarrassment to his 
father, the Count of Tiburn. As a result, he has been given a degree of freedom 
even his elder brothers are envious of, though his father hopes he will one day 
settle down enough to become a marriageable suitor for the daughter of the Duke 
of Euper. Far craftier than he is often given credit for, Owyn has a keen eye 
for detail and can often see patterns invisible to those around him.<p>

All his life, Owyn has dreamed of studying magic and on many occasions has set 
elaborate plots in motion to spend time with masters of the arcane crafts. He 
undertook his most notable endeavor when he was only fourteen and vacationing in 
the city of Ran. Having spent the previous summer needling the household staff 
about his father's accounts, Owyn discovered a means of redirecting a portion of 
his father's wealth and managed to hire a magical tutor for nearly seven months. 
Finally his father detected his activities and recalled him home to Tiburn. 
Thereafter the Beleforte household staff was ordered to strict silence while in 
master Owyn's presence.<p>
<a name=jam>
<center><font size=+3 color=#00cccc>JAMES</font></center>

<img src="jameface.gif" width=94 height=122 align=left hspace=20><p>

Once known as Jimmy the Hand, Seigneur James is the son of the Upright Man, the 
leader of the thieves' guild in Krondor, though James is not aware of his true 
heritage.<p>His thieving skills and quickness were legendary, but now, elevated to 
the nobility by Prince Arutha, Seigneur James has taken his position of 
authority very seriously, though he still wanders his old thief haunts in 
disguise on occasion. He is extremely loyal to Arutha, and will do anything his 
liege lord asks him to do.<p>
<a name=pat>
<center><font size=+3 color=#00cccc>PATRUS</font></center>

<img src="patrface.gif" width=94 height=122 align=left hspace=20><p>

Before the days of Pug's Academy of Magic at Stardock, Patrus was kept busy with 
the buzzing questions of his young apprentices. Now he finds himself without 
students, a fact that bothers him more than he cares to admit. From time to time 
he is called upon to work some minor magic or another, but few tasks truly 
challenge his abilities.<p>

Although Patrus seems addle-brained at times, his <font color=#999999>(sic)</font> is numbered among the most 
capable magicians in Midkemia. Wrinkled as yesterday's laundry, his face is 
greatly expressive. Although he is balding, the sides of his head still foster 
white wisps of hair and his pointed chin is covered with a haze of beard. He 
walks with a slight hunch, is still fairly spry for his age and has no problem 
keeping up with his younger companions.<p>
<a name=pug>
<center><font size=+3 color=#00cccc>PUG</font></center>

<img src="pugface.gif" width=94 height=122 align=left hspace=20><p>

Orphaned at a young age, Pug was raised in the kitchens of Crydee in the Western 
Empire. Apprenticed to Kulgan the magician, he showed little magical promise 
initially. Pug was captured and enslaved by the Tsurani during the Riftwar. 
Seeing vast potential in the boy, the Great Ones of the Tsurani Empire began to 
train him in the magic of the Greater Path. When Pug returned to Midkemia, he 
helped bring an end to the Riftwar with the help of Macros the Black. He was 
adopted into the royal family and awarded land to begin his Academy of Magic at 
Stardock. His irresistible friendliness belies the fact that he is the 
unchallenged master of magic in Midkemia. Pug is the father of two, an adopted 
daughter, Gamina, who possesses telepathic powers, and William, his natural son.<p>
