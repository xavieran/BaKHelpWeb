I have given express instruction that I was not to be disturbed today, but Miri seemed to think 
your visit might be of some importance.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
I don't know that it is important, but I would think you would be a bit more receptive to your 
own kin, uncle.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CORVALIS:</font>
Don't presume to lecture me on manners, Owyn. If you were the proper squire your father dubbed 
you years ago, you would be in Tiburn at your brother Harold's side. Instead, you are allowed to
roam wherever you like, without a whit of accountability to anyone. My daughter Ugyne has far 
more sense of responsibility.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
You have quite a few opinions for someone who hasn't seen me in three years. Have you always 
hated me this much?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CORVALIS:</font>
It's not a question of hatred, Owyn. But your roaming about the world like you were a jongleur 
or a mercenary is an embarrassment to the family. How do you ever hope to gain the hand of a 
duke or an earl's daughter if you continue behaving as you are? How will you learn to rule?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
What? Sit about all day long and tell quarrelling franklins who owns this bit of land and who 
owns that? I don't want that. I want to be a magician, like Pug of Stardock.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CORVALIS:</font>
And are you going to conjure up your living by doing parlor tricks for King Lyam? Going to make 
smoke pour out of your ears so you'll have a bit of something to eat in the evenings?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
I hate to disrupt your argument Count, but at the moment he is in my service as my squire. I am 
Seigneur Locklear of Krondor, adviser to Prince Arutha.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CORVALIS:</font>
From Krondor? My forgiveness, I hadn't noticed your colors. And I have been standing here 
conducting a family spat! What can I do for you?<p>

<blockquote>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Not that I dislike your new house here, but what happened to the Keep?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CORVALIS:</font>
The townhouse is temporary lodging, nephew. We have no intention of staying in Cavall like 
common folk. As for the Keep, one night three years ago, an inept chamber maid left a lamp 
unattended by the tapestries which hung on the west wall. You remember them don't you, Owyn?
Centuries old, woven by the finest weavers in all the Kingdom. In seconds they went up in flames
and they took the rest of the Keep with it.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
I remember having heard something about a fire, but I hadn't known the Keep had burned to the 
ground. It's a miracle that you all survived. Were you able to save anything?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CORVALIS:</font>
We saved ourselves, Owyn, the only things of true value that were within the castle. It is 
regrettable that the girl who was responsible for the blaze was killed, but Ugyne and I both 
escaped it hale and hearty. I ordered only the stones of the foundation left behind and the 
tunnel mouth sealed. We progress forward with our lives.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Why go to all that trouble?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CORVALIS:</font>
I really would prefer not to speak of this anymore. It brings me great grief and I would prefer 
to discuss other matters.<p>

Why should it concern you? I have paid my taxes to the king.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
We wish to borrow money and we want to make certain that we deal with a reputable firm. I 
thought that if you had done any business with him, made any deposits, then perhaps you might 
know if he was an honest man.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CORVALIS:</font>
Ah. Suspicion in business is a healthy tactic. To answer you, I have had no need to 
borrow any funds of late and in fact have made several substantial deposits recently. Some 
of my better placed investments have provided me with comfortable profits, Banath be praised. 
Isunatus will do well by you.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
You have a reputation for disliking Navon du Sandau. Anything you would care to share with us?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CORVALIS:</font>
And what makes you believe I have animosity for Ugyne's suitor?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Your petition to Kahooli. You asked for Navon to be - how did you put it - driven mad until he 
is grey with age?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CORVALIS:</font>
Who did you pay to get that note? Do you have spies in the Temple?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Nothing so insidious as that, Count. It seems the petition collectors from the Temple of Kahooli
have been slow to do their duties this year. We found your note and your tithe. If you tell us 
why you wish him driven mad, I'll let this little matter slip my mind. Otherwise, I think I can 
take up the matter with du Sandau.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CORVALIS:</font>
Do what you will, Seigneur. He already knows my feelings for him. I simply wish him gone from my
family and his meddling in our affairs... Day and night, he is at Ugyne, asking her questions 
about the Keep and Cavall Run. How extensive were the tunnels that ran under the great hall? 
Have they ever been mapped in any great detail? How much money is in my coffers? What are my 
schedules? With whom do I meet? His questions are endless... I lost a wife in that infernal 
Keep and I wish the matter put to rest. I never wish to hear another question again about it! 
Can you understand that, Seigneur? He brings up memories and feelings I wish to leave buried...<p>

I want a direct answer from you Count. Do you have any association with the Guild of Death, yes

<font color=#ffcc00>CORVALIS:</font>
What nonsense is this?! Why should you even believe it possible?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Navon Du Sandau told us you have hired assassins on many occasions.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CORVALIS:</font>
As bodyguards! Who better to hire to watch me than those who have made a profession of stalking 
others? But I have never employed a member of the Guild of Assassins for any other cause. Those 
in my employ guard my estates and the persons of myself and my daughter. Nothing else.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
How did you manage to contact these men?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CORVALIS:</font>
I asked the priests at Kahooli to send the men to me, so I never knew how to contact them 
directly. After the Keep burned down I asked for more help, but the priests told me the 
Nighthawks had fallen into disfavor with the Temple and that they could no longer summon them 
to service.<p>

I haven't time to talk at the moment. Perhaps your father runs his affairs in a more lax manner 
down in Tiburn, but here in Cavall - we do things properly here. If I am to raise a daughter to 
be a future princess, then I must see to it that she is well accustomed to the manner of court 
life.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
<i>Princess</i> Ugyne? And how do you intend to arrange that? I thought she was engaged to the Baronet 
Ferone.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CORVALIS:</font>
The operative word being <i>was</i>, nephew. I have decided that we should aim higher for
her. The Prince of Krondor has two boys, both unmarried and more than eligible for the hand of 
my fair daughter. I think either would make a fine husband.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I agree, but with all due respect, Borric and Erland are only two very rambunctious eleven year 
olds who still run away from girls. I think the pair of them would be horrified by a proposal 
at this point, though I imagine Prince Arutha might find the idea appealing.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CORVALIS:</font>
I wouldn't suggest they marry as yet, of course. They will need a little time to grow naturally,
say two years. Thirteen is a very marriageable age.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Ahem. Once I return to Krondor, I'll mention it to Prince Arutha.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CORVALIS:</font>
I would be forever in your debt Seigneur. Is there anything I can do for you in return?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Weren't you a spotter for the Natalese Rangers when you were younger? I seem to recall you 
telling stories when I used to visit at the Keep.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CORVALIS:</font>
That was quite a long time ago, indeed. Before you or Ugyne or even Neville had been born. I 
still have the eye too. I can tell you precisely how much a man is carrying by the way he walks 
or how good a swordsman he is by the way he pulls it free of the scabbard.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Sounds like a useful skill. Any chance you could teach us something about it?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CORVALIS:</font>
Don't be absurd. I spent five years training to be a spotter. You expect for me to teach it all 
to you in one afternoon?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I suppose you're right. I'm already a decent spotter myself. I'll make you a wager though. You 
teach us anything I don't already know and I'll pay you in gold sovereigns.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CORVALIS:</font>
I'll take your wager, but I'm not one to waste my time. Two hundred sovereigns or it's no deal.
Will you take that wager?<p>

The Count extended his arms. "Which hand do I fight with?" the Count asked.<p>

James squinted, the distance making an accurate evaluation difficult. For several hours the 
Count had unabashedly chastised him for his lack of ability at assessing the strength of his 
enemies.<p>

"My guess is your right hand."<p>

"Good," the Count said. "Why?"<p>

"Your sword is slung on your left hip," James replied flatly. While it was the obvious answer, 
the Count was unimpressed with his practicality. Noting he was about to be regaled about 
ignoring subtle clues, he quickly added. "And the callus on the pads of your right thumb and the
base of your fingers."<p>

bet, boy. Let's get back inside."<p>
