They were not alone.<p>

Gorath's pulse quickened as he saw the lone figure approach; but when it became apparent they 
were not being attacked, he relaxed a bit, squinted slightly in an attempt to see who was about
to join them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CALIN:</font>
If you had not slain that Wyvern... I am grateful, but I beg you go from this place cousin and 
take with you the evil you have brought. You may not take what will not have you, you cannot 
harm what will not be harmed. You and your people belong among your own.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
I do not raid with my kin. Grant me passage, eledhel. I have come to look upon the face of the 
Shining Moon.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CALIN:</font>
The old tongue... I think then your coming will be well received in Elvandar. Tell my mother 
and Warleader Tomas I am well and I will continue on toward Moraelin to meet the moredhel there.
Perhaps we can yet put a halt to their raids.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
What's the Shining Moon? Is it in Elvandar?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CALIN:</font>
She, not it, young human friend. Your companion refers to our Queen Aglaranna. In your tongue 
it means something like Shining Moon.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Is the way to Elvandar passable?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CALIN:</font>
The attacks directed by the moredhel have made travel a difficulty. Fires are burning all 
across Elvandar and the Spellweavers are hard pressed to attend to them all. Most roads are 
impassable, but the western path was clear last I heard of it.<p>

Delekhan has dealt us a great deal of grief this day and in some small way he must pay in
measure. I hope that your journeys have done you greater good this day than mine have done me.<p>

SURVIVAL</font>
</td></tr>

<blockquote>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
I'm surprised you've been able to survive alone with the moredhel raiding over your borders. 
How have you escaped?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CALIN:</font>
The moredhel can do little harm to the eledhel within Elvandar and they would be fools to try. 
It would take remarkable strength of will for a moredhel to enter the forest with any evil 
intent and even a more remarkable will for him to survive such an attempt. It is part of the 
magic that protects our home.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
What about Gorath? He hasn't had any problems entering the forest.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CALIN:</font>
You have not told the boy?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
My returning is of no consequence to him. He has his own quest to fulfill.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CALIN:</font>
Returning? You mean you've been here before?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CALIN:</font>
You will understand certain things later should events unfold as I imagine. There is still the 
matter of your survival to deal with, however. Though our cousin Gorath moves with great grace, 
you are not so sure-footed. For your part in my rescue, I should like to teach you how to move 
the elven way.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
What about Gorath?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CALIN:</font>
It is not custom between our kin, but if you wish it...I will teach him what I know of using a 
crossbow... Come. We cannot be long at this.<p>

Calin waited.<p>

Seated cross-legged on the ground, he watched through half-lidded eyes as Owyn approached from 
a thick copse of trees. Although he still moved with little grace, he had made remarkable 
improvement in a short time.<p>

"Do I move like an elf now?" Owyn asked, a look of eager anticipation written on his face.<p>

"I wouldn't try to sneak up on the Warleader as yet, but yes, you have learned a bit," the elf
replied. "Why don't you go around and try it again? You were still rustling the leaves as you 
approached."<p>

Once the boy was gone, Calin shifted his gaze to study Gorath's progress with the crossbow. 
Though it was readily apparent the moredhel was capable of doing great damage with the weapon, 
his concentration was elsewhere.<p>

"I am told the call can be painful if one is uncertain of their feelings," Calin said. "You 
need not endure the pain. We will welcome you no matter who or what you might have been to us 
in the past."<p>

Gorath nodded without looking at the elf, his gaze fixed straight ahead as he resighted his 
crossbow with trembling hands and fired into the undergrowth.<p>

"Hey!" Owyn shouted in the distance. Crashing back through the brush, he reentered the clearing.
"Could you be a little more careful where you're firing that thing? That last shot came far too 
close to me."<p>

Rising to his feet, Calin shook his head. "Then it is time the lessons came to an end."<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
How have you been holding off the wyverns? I would have thought this many of them could have 
burned Elvandar to the ground.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CALIN:</font>
Fortunately, the spells the moredhel have been using to control them aren't too strong or too 
complicated. Even with what little knowledge I have about magic, Tathar managed to teach me a 
cantrip that will turn them away.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Sounds like it might come in useful. If you have time, do you think you could teach it to me?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CALIN:</font>
You can have the scroll I studied. I don't think I will need it any longer, though I warn you, 
you'll need to find one of those beast's eggs each time you cast the spell. Tathar tried to 
explain the principle to me, but I had trouble following the complexities of it.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
What way will take us the most quickly to Elvandar?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CALIN:</font>
If it were merely a matter of which way would take the least distance, I would suggest you take 
the northern bridge, but I understand from my scouts that wyverns have been alighting in heavy 
numbers near there. It would be far less dangerous to travel to the far western bridge and there
cross through the sleeping glades, though you may have some difficulties dealing with them. From
there, bear directly north until you reach Grey Horn. You will find an entrance to a 
subterranean, ancient ruin there. Once you emerge from it, you will be very near the heart of 
Elvandar itself.<p>

ANCIENT RUIN</font>
</td></tr>
</table><p>

<blockquote>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
One nice thing about travelling underground, at least there is less chance of something dropping
down on us from above. With all these wyverns flying about, I half expect one to come flapping 
out of nowhere any time I turn my head.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CALIN:</font>
You may not find you are quite so enthusiastic about the ancient ruin once you pass through it. 
We do not use it much.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Please tell me it isn't infested with a Brak Nurr or something equally repulsive.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CALIN:</font>
Infested? An interesting description, but not in the way you may think. None of the elven blood 
may easily walk its corridors without some measure of dread.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
It is of the Valheru, then.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CALIN:</font>
The Warleader assures us none of their ancient essence may touch us here, but the malevolence 
that permeates that place cannot be easily dismissed. We have not been so foolish, however, to 
leave it open to any that wish simply to enter it. There is too great a danger something there 
has been unfound that is beyond our control. Only a few of the elves have a key that will unlock
its doors.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
How are we going to get in, then?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CALIN:</font>
I will give Gorath the key I carry. That is all that is required.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
As simple as that?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CALIN:</font>
There is nothing simple about it. The force of will it has taken for Gorath to have come even 
this close to Elvandar is monumental. Unless his reason for being here was of the utmost 
importance, he would have fled this forest long ago.<p>

I trust him.<p>

SLEEPING GLADES</font>
</td></tr>
</table><p>

<blockquote>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
You said we might encounter some difficulty with the sleeping glades?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CALIN:</font>
It is one of Elvandar's natural defenses. Those who enter them suddenly find themselves quite 
drowsy and will sleep for days on end. Many die in their sleep from lack of nourishment.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Effective, if non-selective. I assume there is a way they may be crossed.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CALIN:</font>
It wouldn't be practical to live in a house for which there is no door. Though the sizes of the 
glades are variable, when you approach them, you'll experience a slight feeling of
disorientation. There is, however, a little known path that can carry you safely through them.
The glades run parallel to a mountain range Southwest of here, north of the river's fork. They 
are difficult to cross, but you may circumnavigate them. If you head to the fork of the river 
then stay close to the mountains to the north, you should be untroubled by the glades.<p>
