Most of these items can easily be picked up from Caches and Enemies, and should
never be bought, unless there is no other choice. Some items, especially the Aventurine
and the Shovel, may be scarce, or hard to find at the beginning of the game.<p>

<blockquote>

<table width=90% border=0>
<tr><td align=left valign=top><font size=+1><b>RATIONS</b></font><p>
<font color=green><b>
3531 Rations can be picked up
from Caches and Enemies.<p>
389 are Spoiled, 450
are Poisoned.<p>
Rations are for sale in some Shops
and all Inns.</b>
</font></td><td valign=top>
<img src="rations.gif" width=174 height=106></td><td><b>
Rations are automatically consumed at midnight. If no Rations are present in
Inventory, the Character will enter a Starving Condition, which will get worse
at every midnight. This will affect Stamina, and ultimately Health and all other
Skills. Beware of Spoiled and Poisoned Rations! There's a lot of them about, and
if they're present in Inventory, they will get consumed, if no Normal Rations
are available. Sick and Poisoned Conditions will result. Both Conditions escalate
by the hour, and will adversely affect Skills. <font color=#00ffff>TIP: Spoiled Rations are actually
quite harmless, if you make sure that your Characters are RESTING at midnight, when
they are consumed. They will only get Sick if they are travelling. But even so, the resulting
Sickness is easily cured by a couple of hours' sleep.</font></b><p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td align=left valign=top><font size=+1><b>RESTORATIVES</b></font><p>
<font color=green><b>
Caches (52) = 885<br>
Enemies (63) = 216<br>
Sold by 19 Shops
</b></font></td><td valign=top>
<img src="restorat.gif" width=174 height=106></td><td><b>
Each use will randomly regain 6 or 7 lost Health/Stamina points, and additionally
reduce any Condition [except Healing] by 5 points. <font color=#999999>(The number of Conditions is
irrelevant - even if multiple Conditions are present, they will ALL be reduced.)</font></b><p></td></tr>

<tr><td align=left valign=top><font size=+1><b>HERBAL PACK</b></font><p>
<font color=green><b>
Caches (42) = 342<br>
Enemies (49) = 114<br>
Sold by 20 Shops
</b></font></td><td valign=top>
<img src="herbalp.gif" width=174 height=106></td><td><b>
Each use will result in 100% Healing Condition. 3% will be used up every hour,
so the effect will last for 33 hours. The Healing effect is much greater during
Rest. In fact, all the escalating Conditions (most importantly Poison and Plague)
can be Healed by a combination of Herbal Packs and Sleep. <font color=#00ffff>TIP: Take care! If you
haven't Healed fully after 33 hours' Sleep, you will need to re-use the Herbal
Pack. Otherwise the Condition will start escalating again.</font><p>
</b></td></tr>

<tr><td align=left valign=top><font size=+1><b>PICKLOCKS</b></font><p>
<font color=green><b>
Caches (31) = 111<br>
Enemies (23) = 58<br>
Sold by 8 Shops
</b></font></td><td valign=top>
<img src="pcklocks.gif" width=174 height=106></td><td><b>
Some locks can only be picked, others can be opened with either Keys or Picklocks (if
your Lockpicking Skill is up to it), still others can only be opened with Special
Keys. Using Picklocks will raise a Character's Lockpicking Skill. If you're patient,
you can raise your Skill by trying again and again, whenever you come across a Lock.
If you come across a lock that you can pick successfully, you can raise your skill even
faster by repeatedly picking it. Disregardless of who is holding the Picklocks, the game will
always, by default, choose the Character with the highest Skill, but you can choose
a different Character yourself. In Chapter 1, Locklear is the default Lockpicker, but
Gorath really needs to raise his Skill, so make sure he's allowed to practice. <font color=#00ffff>
TIP: Before Lockpicking (especially if you're in for a heavy session), make sure that
ONLY your Lockpicking Skill is SELECTED. This will make it rise 50% faster!</font><p>
</b></td></tr>

<tr><td align=left valign=top><font size=+1><b>TORCH</b></font><p>
<font color=green><b>
Caches (27) = 112<br>
Enemies (40) = 118<br>
Sold by 13 Shops
</b></font></td><td valign=top>
<img src="torch.gif" width=174 height=106></td><td><b>
If you can't see a thing after dark, or in a Dungeon, light a Torch (not in the Naphtha
Mines, though). Each Torch lasts 8 hours. The Magical equivalents last longer:
RING OF PRANDUR (24 hours), STARDUSK Spell [above only] (12 hours, if Cast at 15 points),
CANDLEGLOW Spell [below only] (12 hours, if Cast at 15 points). <font color=green>It should
be noted that the need for extra light may depend upon your hardware. I have played two
different versions of BAK on three different computers, and never needed to light a Torch.
Others have complained about extreme darkness, even at NOON!</font><p>

Needed in order to swing over Pits in Dungeons. <font color=#00ffff>In order to cross a
Pit, you must walk up to it, and then left-click it (as you would a Door). The game will
take care of the rest. </font><font color=#999999>An hidden feature of Pits: If you fall
into a Pit, punch (very quickly!) the "P" key on your keyboard. This will allow you to
view the bottom of the Pit.</font><p>

Robbery, so make sure your Rations are OK, if you're just about to desecrate a big Graveyard.
Rations will be consumed at every midnight.</b></font>

<img src="hammer.gif" width=174 height=106><td><b>
Needed in order to Repair Armor. The quality of the Repair will depend on the
Repairer's Skill, so it is generally a good idea to give the Armor to the Character
with the best Skill, have him Repair it, and then give it back. In the case of
superfluous Armor you intend to sell - make sure you Repair it first, in order to
get the best price possible. <font color=#ff00ff>Each Use of the Hammer will raise your Armorcraft Skill.

Skill is SELECTED. This will make the Skill go up 50% faster! </font><font color=#999999>
