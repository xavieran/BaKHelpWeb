<h2>PUG'S SECOND NOTE</h2></center><hr>
<blockquote><font size=+1><b>
Tomas:<p>
While I discovered no evidence of Gamina at the ruin, I have learned
the manna on this planet has undergone metamorphic concretion, or in
simpler terms, transformed into crystal. As there is no natural phenomenon
that can account for this, I can only assume the change was engineered by
an agency of the most supreme order. It is doubtful the Valheru could have
mastered it as it would have had cataclysmic effects beyond their control,
though it may have given Draken-Korin the inspiration for the Lifestone
under Sethanon. I can only assume at this point the ancient gods of this
planet may have used the tactic to drive away the Valheru. Again, this you
would know better than I.<p>
I made my discovery when I touched one of the crystal columns in the ruin
and sensed the power of it. At the same time, I sensed within what I will
tentatively call an intelligence because I felt the stirrings of mind-speech
though no specific thoughts ever formed. If you go to the ruin don't touch
the central column. I felt greatly ill for several days after touching that
particular column, though I am not certain of the cause and avoided the rest
thereafter. Perhaps after I have found Gamina, I will have opportunity to
learn more.<p>
