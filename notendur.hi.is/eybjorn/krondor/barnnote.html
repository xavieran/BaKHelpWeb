<h2>KNIGHT'S PIECE NOTE</h2></center><hr>
<blockquote><font size=+1><b>
We have reason to believe that Gorath of the Ardanien will soon be in your region.
Should you encounter him, attempt to take him alive. If you are overmatched, then slay him
before he discovers our connections to the Nighthawks. We wish have him breathing, so that
we may make a present of him to Delekhan and The Six. Otherwise, you are to proceed in the usual
fashion by retrieving the Knight's Piece from the well. It is crucial we have the
information the Nighthawks have gathered on troop strengths at the Kingdom garrisons.<p>
