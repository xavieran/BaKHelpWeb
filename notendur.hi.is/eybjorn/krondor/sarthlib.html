The Sarth Library can be visited in Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 6. A lot of useful
information can be gleaned from books found here. At least 13 books can be
accessed here. But there is a slight problem.<p>
Five different "shelves" are available (see 1 - 5 in the picture above).
By clicking on a "shelf" you can read, or attempt to read, a book. Each
"shelf" is endlessly available for re-clicking. In order to gain access to
all available books on a "shelf" you may need to click repeatedly. There's
a random factor at work here, so you may have to click quite often in order
to find all the available books on each "shelf". Be careful! Lots of Rations
will be consumed while you're clicking away!<p>
As far as I've been able to ascertain, Shelf #1 contains three useful books.
Shelf #2 is restricted at all times. Shelf #3 contains four books of importance,
Shelf #4 only two, and Shelf #5 four useful books. Shelf #6 won't be accessible 
until Chapter 6, where an Owyn-Gorath dialogue will be triggered.<p>
Below you will find all the relevant information from Shelves 1, 3, 4, and 5.<p>

If it may be at all arranged, it is best to confront your enemy on a
battleground of your own choosing in such a way that you have the element
of surprise and command any setpieces which might mean the turning of the
battle. If, however, your opponent has command of magical or ballistic means,
it is always a better stratagem to close range so as to deny him the ability
to load his weapons without obstruction ...<p></b></td>

A rather simple tactic first applied during the battle of Carse against
the goblins was the use of the spell sometimes known as Invitation. Thought
of as a mere prank by studying magicians, it became quite effective during the
battle when Althafain used it to drag a band of the Dark Brothers into a trap
which they had devised ...<p>

This last chapter is reserved for the most well prepared of soldiers who 
are also familiar with the enemies they are to face on the battlefield. With
an adequate amount of information before a battle, it is entirely possible for
an enemy to be defeated even when the enemy has an advantage of surprise, providing
you learn what their natural weaknesses are. By exploiting this feature, it is
possible to take down enemies who might otherwise seem unkillable. Based on reports
gathered from soldiers from different battle situations, it would seem that the
following things tend to be true:<br>
<img src="bil6.gif" width=50 height=1>
Trolls in general seem to take more harm when they are attacked with any form of
magic, but they likewise are quite resistant to physical harm.<br>
<img src="bil6.gif" width=50 height=1>
When fighting magicians of any stripe, it seems they are generally poor when
it comes to hand to hand combat, though there are exceptions to this rule. Though
wyverns have never to my knowledge been exploited for use in battle, farmers troubled 
by the red variety have spoken of good results when attacking with blades prepared
with an Althafain's Icer.<br>
<img src="bil6.gif" width=50 height=1>
I highly suggest that in the future you attempt to take notice of similar weaknesses
and resistances so you may use your resources to the fullest advantage.<p>

Blessed of Dala be the daughters of Flendel Halfgate; so named Thea, Andrea,
Gena, Sara, Kira, and Larissa; who in good mercy hath been rightworthy and
true to the goddess, having provided much needed leather goods, grain, and
entertainment for the woefully poor in their hour of need. From this day in
the second year of the reign of good king Lyam the first, forever shall your
issue be watched over by the fortunes of the goddess.

After an expansive description of Kahooli, the God of Revenge, and how he was
often misperceived by most of the common folk of the Kingdom, the book made brief
mention of a series of penances required of the faithful including an odd practice
known as mortification in which they starved themselves to make themselves worthy
to the temple. It also listed the fact that the most frequent petitioners into the
temple were assassins.

Thankfully the contents of the book on Sung, God of Purity and Healing, were
relatively light and easy to read, though it told him little he didn't already know
about the Teple of Sung and its tenants. Before closing it, he did take special heed
of the fact it implied that the Temple of Sung offered more extensive healing powers
than those offered by any other temple.

to include here examples of the finest shops in the Kingdom, examples which illustrate my
point rather elegantly that good attention to finances will allow the shopkeeper to offer
the lowest prices without sacrificing significant profit and ensuring a reliable returning
clientele:<p><blockquote>

... in comparisons, it has seemed that herbal packs by far offer more beneficial effects,

Immediately as may be performed, the injured party should be conveyed to the locality of
an inn or other place they may spend the night out of the night's humors. Once bedded, it is
advised they be administered four dosages of restoratives and a herbal treatment. Providing
they are left undisturbed for a period of three days, the chances are reasonable that they
will recover from their "near-dead" condition ...

... following the unfortunate events which transpired shortly following the ascension of
Arutha conDoin to the Princedom of Krondor. Unfortunately, since that time, border barons have
seen a proliferation of the use of this poison, now harvested in mass dosages on the shores of
Moraelin and elsewhere within the Northlands. If there may be said there is any good in this, 
it is that the new strains of Silverthorn now used are significantly less harmful than those
used to wound Princess Anita ten years ago. Although many scholars have been speculating that
perhaps only the nutrients in the soil near the Black Lake give the plant its lethality, the true
causes of this shift is unknown.<br><img src="bil6.gif" width=50 height=1>
Fortunately, in the case of the Princess, I was able to formulate a Silverthorn anti-venom which
may be taken internally to neutralize the poison, and it may be that I can make it into a treatment
that may be smeared on armor to neutralize the effects of any Silverthorn poisoned blade which comes
into contact with it ...
