Locklear motioned to the figure across the room.<p>

The man walked over to join them. He stood before them, eyebrows arched inquisitively.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JOFTAZ:</font>
The boy has the look of a magician about him. Has he been...educated?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
I had a few tutors when I was young - my father brought them to our manor - I had an instructor 
once named Patrus in Tiburn.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JOFTAZ:</font>
Ha ha. Impressive background, my young friend.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Owyn...please, you shouldn't brag so much. People might think you're someone that you're not...<p>
Why the interest in my nephew's education, tavernkeep? Are you looking for a tutor for your 
children?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JOFTAZ:</font>
No children have I, at the least, none that I know of. I was merely concerned that a boy with 
talent should go to waste.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
So far, the only talent that my wayward nephew has shown is a talent for eating too much and 
complaining too volubly. I assure you he won't be wasted on anything.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JOFTAZ:</font>
I feel certain of that. Could I interest you in something to eat? I would offer you something 
fresh, but a thief slipped in during the night and stole most of our provisions. I have some 
older provisions that you might take a chance on.<p>

James motioned to the barkeep.<p>

The man looked up from the goblets he was washing and smiled in their direction, obviously happy
to have more customers. But his welcome expression changed to a mixture of fear and outrage and 
he began to scream at them in a language James didn't understand.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JOFTAZ:</font>
Ruthi a'dibi abas! The contagion! The contagion!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Please...my companions and I are ill and in need of help. Where might we find someone who knows 
how to heal us?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JOFTAZ:</font>
None may heal you! The Dancer Through Men's Hearts has marked you for her dance and none may 
save you! Go now, please before you infect me!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
If a goddess has marked us, then only a goddess may be able to save us. What temples may be 
close by? Who is the local patron goddess?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JOFTAZ:</font>
My men will be here soon! You will regret waiting!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Tell me where the nearest temple is or I will come over there, pin you to the floor and my
companions and I will take turns spitting down your throat until you crawl with this disease! 
Where is a temple?!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JOFTAZ:</font>
The Mist Devil is anchored in harbor and it sometimes will take passengers to the Temple of
Eortis on Temple Isle. The man on board will ask for ten gold pieces. I hope the boat crashes 
and takes the three of you to your deaths! Now be gone!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
And none too soon. Expect another visit from us, barkeep.<p>

Why do you wish us gone?<p>

If you are here, you have crossed paths with those who work for the Crawler. All who cross him 
die.<p>

You wouldn't happen to mean some men who were waiting outside of town, would you?<p>

James motioned to the figure across the room.<p>

The man walked over to join them. He stood before them, eyebrows arched inquisitively.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
As the keeper of a tavern, I imagine you get quite a bit of traffic through here, lots of people
wanting to buy or sell items that were - shall we say - indiscriminately acquired? Who would I 
speak to if my interests lay in that direction?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JOFTAZ:</font>
Any that walks the streets. Silden is not known for its reputable patronage as you no doubt have
seen. Why would this interest you?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I need to find out about the possible purchase of two very special items that might have been 
picked up here in Silden. I'm looking for whoever might have sold them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JOFTAZ:</font>
If an item is sold in Silden then I am the only man that you should speak to. Any other 
transactions are done the Silden way.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Very well, Joftaz. I need to find out what you may know about either a brass spyglass or a
silver spider. I would be willing pay in gold.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JOFTAZ:</font>
You will pay, most undoubtedly for that information, but I am not interested in your Kingdom
coins. If it were gold I could come up with the sum I want myself. No, what I require is the
assistance of a thief.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Why do you think I would be of any help?<p> 

<font color=#ffcc00>JOFTAZ:</font>
I live in a city of thieves. I have spent my life knowing how to sense them and I know most
assuredly that you have a thief's instincts. This is the bargain. I will tell you about the
silver spiders that I sell on occasion, and you will find a bag of powder that was stolen by
the Crawler. It has most likely been taken to his house near here. The house is locked and I 
suspect that the pouch will be hidden away in a chest or cabinet or such.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Any thief could do that for you. Why would we be especially qualified for this?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JOFTAZ:</font>
Because all the thieves in this place - they all are the hands and eyes of the Crawler. To be
working for me, that would be death for them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Why? What is it that is in this powder bag?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JOFTAZ:</font>
I have made my offer. The information for the pouch. Do we have a deal?<p>

My bump of trouble is telling me that I shouldn't be agreeing to this, but you have a deal,
Joftaz. I'll get your pouch. A straight exchange, the information for the item.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JOFTAZ:</font>
Consider it a deal then. I will wait for you here in the Anchorhead until you return with the
item.<p>

There was a time when I was considered the best thief in Krondor, but that time has long passed.<p>
I am a seigneur in Prince Arutha's court and I've fought hard to deserve that title.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JOFTAZ:</font>
No doubt, but I think you will change your mind if you really wish to know the things you have
asked about. No rumormonger in Silden knows more than Joftaz and very few of them can be so 
easily bought. I shall see you again, I am quite certain.<p>

Your arrogance will one day get you into trouble. Do not presume to know the minds of others.

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
It seems that today Banath has smiled on the both of us. I have what you want, and you
apparently know what I need to know. The pouch in exchange for the story. That was the deal. I
want to hear a story about a silver spider.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JOFTAZ:</font>
Heh. Yes, Banath has gifted you most certainly. I wouldn't have thought anyone wily enough to 
defeat the Crawler, but if the Happy Prankster has given you the knack then I'll happily help 
you as best I can. Now - the silver spider is a rare item so I remember when I get one and am 
most assuredly pleased when I can turn a profit from one. They are heartily sought here in the 
Kingdom. It's been several months since last I sold one.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Can you describe the last man who bought one?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JOFTAZ:</font>
Oh, aye, I can describe him. Stoop backed, crass, hard bartering fellow. He was wearing a black 
cloak and a bird - an eagle - was blazed across his chest.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
You mean a hawk? A golden hawk?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JOFTAZ:</font>
I have lived the greater part of my days here in Silden. It might have been a hawk or it could 
have been a gull. All I know is that I lost a great deal that day between he and the trader
named Abuk who brought in some sailor's trinkets he appropriated from Prank's Stone. As for the
man with the bird on his chest, the last I heard of him he was asking to purchase a ticket on a
ship called the Mocker's Folly bound for Krondor.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
A Nighthawk bound for Krondor? Where could I find the ship's captain?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JOFTAZ:</font>
Krondor, I suspect, though I don't see why that would be important to you.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I will decide what is important or unimportant. Now, what about the brass spyglass? Would you
know anything about that?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JOFTAZ:</font>
As I told you before, sailor's trinkets are common here in Silden. If it is a special glass you 
covet I would urge you to seek out the trader, Abuk. I could hope only to make five, perhaps ten
gold sovereigns from such an item so I decided they were not really worth my time bothering 
with them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
You may find that bothering with silver spiders has cost you more than imagined, Joftaz. If I 
find that any of the Prince's family have died of poisoning when I return there, you'll have a 
great deal more to worry about than turning a profit.<p>

</td><td valign=top>
<b>
<font color=#ffcc00>JOFTAZ:</font>
I am assuming that you are here to speak about the item which we discussed. You have been
expedient in finding it.<p>

Before you ask, no we don't have it. I was just hoping that perhaps you would open up a bit
more about...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JOFTAZ:</font>
You forget quickly, but Joftaz is not so slow witted. We have a deal and these lips remain
sealed until I see that which I have asked for. Good bye.<p>

</td><td valign=top>
<b>
<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
No, no...we haven't found it yet. His house is quite difficult to enter. We were hoping that 
perhaps if you told us more of Silden and the people here...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JOFTAZ:</font>
You would play me the fool, but I have lived among sailors too long for such trickery. Our deal
stands. Joftaz tells nothing until you return to me the powder bag for which I have asked.<p>
