Locklear motioned to the figure across the room.<p>

The man walked over to join them. He stood before them, eyebrows arched inquisitively.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DEVON:</font>
What can I do for you to day?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
I do believe this is the loneliest tavern I've ever visited. Where is everyone?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DEVON:</font>
Everyone is elsewhere. With the exception of Rake, myself and a handful of boarders that have 
wandered in from off the road, there's not been another soul in town since the Festival.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Everyone? Why? What happened here?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DEVON:</font>
Come the eighth hour of last evening, a cloaked gentlemen entered through that same door there 
and took a seat. He ordered a joint of beef, a loaf of bread and a mug of ale. I remembered 
these things because I had ordered the same. Soon as he had finished his meal he went to the 
tavernkeeper and tossed down fifty golden sovereigns, turned round and was gone by the door. 
Before the first of those coins stopped their spinning on the counter, the rest of the people 
in the tavern rushed out after him. The keeper didn't even latch the door...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Some sort of deal?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DEVON:</font>
Nope. Some sort of damn local ritual. It seems I arrived in the middle of a ceremony that was 
called the Festival of the Stranger. Traditionally the elders of the town would gather in the 
tavern and draw lots and the one with the longest lot was dubbed The Stranger. On the first 
night of the festival, The Stranger comes around and offers the members of the town fake 
sovereigns - they called them nimptos - and then the citizens of the town leave to sleep in the 
fields. Of course, I wasn't aware of what was going on.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
And they're supposed to stay in the fields?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DEVON:</font>
Ah, no, no, no. The next morning, the elected Stranger is to circle the village three times 
while swinging a strand of hemp over his head. When he is done, he cuts the length of rope and 
sets it on the road to let the people know that they can come back. They then know that Killian 
is looking with good fortune on their township and that she won't strike their fields dead. If 
the strand is not placed, however, it means that she is displeased and any citizen that attempts
to return to town will be struck dead.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Was the Stranger killed by Killian?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DEVON:</font>
No, not Killian, but by a man named the Collector to whom he owed money who didn't know about 
the town's tradition. It didn't matter to the citizens of Eggley, though. They still chose to 
see it as a sign from Killian and they haven't returned since, think the place is cursed and 
won't return until the curse is lifted. They've relocated in Tanneurs, Hawk's Hollow, and a few 
in Malac's Cross. They all believe they've done the right thing and have given me permission to 
do whatever I wanted here. Out of respect for them, I've decided to keep the old town name of 
Eggley.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
I don't know. It seems people would have to be pretty thick to believe all of that.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DEVON:</font>
Would they? Would you have the nerve to spit on a shrine of Ishap?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
No...but...I guess I can see your point.<p><p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DEVON:</font>
Everyone has their beliefs. Many people in these villages at one time were farmers, and it is 
difficult for them to simply turn their backs on the goddess of nature. They require her
blessing before they can go on to new lives. You should remember that before you judge something
to be ignorant. So - as my new job as bartender of this tavern, I suppose it's my duty to see if
you need anything? Can I set you up?<p>

A new life here in Eggley! You remember I told you that on the night I arrived something very 
peculiar happened? All the town's people disappeared, vanished without a trace. When they didn't
come back, I decided to stay here and see what happened, maybe take over the tavern... Damn me 
if they didn't all decide to come back!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
That's good news, isn't it?<p>

All taken, I think so, though I don't know what the ultimate fate of my tending this tavern will

I ought to act like one. What can I get you?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Someone we ran into up the road told us they had seen a moredhel near here. I don't suppose
you've seen him have you?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DEVON:</font>
Him? I've seen enough moredhel to start a barrel ball city league. Whole clump of them came by 
here a few weeks ago heading south in packs of twos and threes down the road towards Tanneurs.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Were they armed?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DEVON:</font>
Like the war god Tith's own legions. Looked like they might be out to sign up as caravan guards,
but who would hire them?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Did you get a look at any of them?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DEVON:</font>
None of them came close enough to the Stranger that I could get a good look at them. Now that I
think of it, it's kind of peculiar. On the off occasions when moredhel will crash through a town,
they'll usually kick up some kind of ruckus with the locals to prove who's the toughest kid on 
the block. These just marched through town like they were in a parade review, like they were 
expecting someone to watch them come through.<p>

choice chests of mercantile, we chained him up in the belly of the ship so we could make a 
present of him to Cassandra. But when we docked in Palanque, all we found in the hold of the
ship was a note saying he could be found in Silden if ever we needed his services. I've never
hired anyone else for a lockpicking job since.<p>

I've had runs of luck like that. Once I was riding high while I was working for the Dauphiness

that, but he suggests I put up the purse I'm carrying for the Dauphiness.<p>

two Yellow Squires and a King's Jester. Lost the whole lot to him. The Dauphiness was less than

Devon waved towards the door. Seizing a pitted Salamanca from under the bar's counter, he

ancient, mold-eaten gravestones.<p>

the mercenary pressed the point of his blade to Locklear' s neck.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
One of the brothers from the Abbey at Sarth has seen several mercenaries on the move through
the principality, and he said they looked Quegian. With a good Quegian name like Devonius, I
was thinking you might know something about them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DEVON:</font>
I haven't had anything to do with the Dauphiness of Queg or her bastard father-in-law for over
three years now. I burned my Writs of Passage the day Spitzer and I boarded the Dauphiness'
war galley, the Storm's Master, and sunk King Lebeus' flagship with all hands on board. Since 
that day, I've only worked for me. Me.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Then you have no idea why there would be so many mercenaries wandering free in the Kingdom?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DEVON:</font>
You don't get more than three Quegian mercenaries together in one spot unless you're paying
them to be together. Small little island like that, most of them have killed a member of another
mercenary's family. Pay them well, they'll put their personal vendettas aside long enough to do 
what's asked of them before they start on one another. Whoever's funding them must have an
incredible fortune in rubies somewhere.<p>

We're looking for a tax collector who went by the name of Stellan. Have any idea where he went
to after the festival?<p> 

<font color=#ffcc00>DEVON:</font>
Third headstone on the right and six feet under, that's where you'll find Stellan. That's the
gentleman that was killed by the Collector. Why are you trying to find him?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
He had an old document I wanted to look at...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DEVON:</font>
It might still be locked up in his office here in town. Be a matter of finding his key, of
course.<p>

<blockquote>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
The brothers at Sarth told us the Quegian Fever is hitting the coastal areas of the principality
hard. You're from Queg. Is there anything we can do about the fever?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DEVON:</font>
For them, nothing. For yourselves, keep off the main roads. When a lot of people get the fever,
they run off from wherever they are in a blind panic and they imagine anyone and everyone around
them as a threat. Stay away from the roads and you should be able to avoid running into them.<p>
