Without looking away from the stranger on the road, Locklear whispered under his breath. "He's 
dressed in a Keshian manner - this may be trouble. Be ready to move at an instant should I say 
the word."<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
It's a hot day to be idling under the sun without shade. Can I assume you're waiting for
someone?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
So I do. A spice trader come from Malac's Cross bound for Silden. I must assume his journey is 
delayed for a time. We shall drink full a fortnight or two in the Empress Inn.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Do you fear that this trader will be harmed in Silden?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
Ah! With an eagle's eye you see the problem - The danger that awaits there is not intended for 
him, nor for any man alone. Strangers live short lives that cross into Silden when the Crawler 
has convened a secret session of his assistants.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
And this Crawler has called such a meeting?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
Even so. At dusk two nights ago a raven was nailed to the doorpost of the Anchorhead Tavern, 
the sign any that hadn't business in Silden should quit the town and quickly. Such it has been 
for several years.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
What of the town constable? He does nothing about this criminal?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
In Kesh it is said that a man cannot see that has gold in his eyes, a man will not look that has
sin in his heart.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
I believe I understand... I think we shall be on our way then and thanks for your news of
Silden.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
Remember, heed the roadsigns. Wander no closer to Silden than you must, for the Crawler's
assistants have great cajunlo - great power.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Thank you, Abuk. We will remember your warning.<p>

They were not alone.<p>

Owyn's pulse quickened as he saw the lone figure approach; but when it became apparent they 
were not being attacked, he relaxed a bit, squinted slightly in an attempt to see who was about 
to join them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Are you still waiting for your friend?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
Even so. Though I have blisters on my tongue and boils on my feet, I shall wait until the sun 
boils away my flesh and maggots chew my brain and even then shall I wait until I have word of 
him.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Maybe something has happened to him.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
I will wait! My thanks for your concern, but I cannot quit my duty to a friend. Travel fairly, 
sir.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
I will. Good luck to you.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
Excuse me, sirs. I will detain you only a few moments. Can you show me the way to Lyton? I am 
told that there is someone there who requires my services to pick a Webber lock. The letter I 
received from there sounded most urgent.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Impossible. A Webber lock cannot be picked.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
Perhaps not by you, but one skilled in the arts of subtlety, he may know how to penetrate even 
the most difficult of locks. It is a matter of patience.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I don't care how patient you are, a Webber lock cannot be picked. You're making idle boasts.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
And what would Abuk gain telling strangers a fact that was not true, eh? I merely say these 
things so I may advertise my services and you might make use of them one day. I state simple 
fact. There is no lock in this Kingdom of yours that Abuk cannot pick. None.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Is that so? Perhaps you could teach us how to pick Webber locks...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
It would take more time than I think you would care to spend. I spent five years at the foot 
of my master Caliphad in the shadow of mount Ashunta learning the art. But I could perhaps 
improve whatever skill you may already possess. A small fee of seventy gold sovereigns should 
pay for my time.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Seventy gold pieces for a lesson in lockpicking? That's nothing short of robbery.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
You are wise. I should not cheat myself in this fashion. Eighty sovereigns, but I cannot raise 
my price any higher, despite the great deference you show to my person. Is the arrangement to be
sealed?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
All right, Keshian. Eighty sovereigns, but I am warning you...I doubt there's anything you can
teach me.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
You must open yourself to new things. This is the first learning. Without this opening you will 
not be complete. Opening your self is like opening a lock. If you cannot open, then the lock may
not open. You should understand that there is no difference between yourself and the lock that 
you pick. All these things I will demonstrate with a test lock that I carry with me. Now I want 
you to observe.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Keshian double...talk. Wait a minute...how did you do that? I couldn't see... Do that again.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
That is it. You have received your first lesson, darkeyes.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
That was too fast. I couldn't catch what you were doing.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
In time you shall realize what was done. In your mind, the events will unlock and thus your 
hands will unlock as well. I must go now. Good bye.<p>

Wait...<p>

</td><td valign=top>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
If I had the money, I would embarrass you Keshian, but unfortunately it seems that I hadn't as 
many sovereigns as I thought.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
Indeed it is unfortunate, for I wish to one day be embarrassed. Perhaps when you have more
money, you can come and we shall test one another. Until that time, I bid you fair travelling.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>

There are many things I enjoy in life, but wasting hard earned money is not one of them. Any
man that claims to be able to pick a Webber lock is undoubtedly a fraud.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
Perhaps you are right. I shall consider these things while I unlock one in Lyton. If you should 
change your mind and we should meet again, however, I would be willing to teach you the things 
that are impossible for me to know. Travel well.<p>

That we will. Good day.<p>

As I told you last time, any man that claims to be able to pick a Webber lock is a fraud. I'm 
not going to throw my money away.<p>

If you should change your mind and we should meet again, I shall attempt once more to prove you 
wrong. Travel well.<p>

Owyn's pulse quickened as he saw the lone figure approach; but when it became apparent they 
were not being attacked, he relaxed a bit, squinted slightly in an attempt to see who was about 
to join them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
The sun shines favorably on you traveller. I am Abuk of Silden, master of locks, son of
Kardeji and student of Caliphad, master among masters of locks.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Save your breath. I haven't the need for a locksmith at the moment. I need information about a 
company of Kingdom soldiers that may have visited Silden recently.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
Many soldiers visit Silden. Some come from the boats that dock there, some come from Lyton or 
places further away. What would distinguish the men you seek from any other men?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
If you noticed them at all, they should have seemed conspicuously inconspicuous. They would 
have drank little and paid whatever shopkeepers asked, no matter how outrageous the price. 
They would have avoided fighting unless it was forced upon them and then it would have been very
evident they were skilled fighters.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
I know of these men. They came to Silden to hire assassins, but Abuk told them they do not need 
assassins.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Hire Nighthawks? No. These men would have been looking for the Nighthawks, but they didn't wish 
to hire them. If anything, they wanted to trick them into the open.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
They asked Abuk to hire assassins, but I told them about my spider and they did not wish to 
hire assassins anymore. They bought the spider and went away to Romney.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
You sold them the silver spider? Why did they wish to buy it?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
They did not tell Abuk and I did not ask. I am only a master of locks and the business of the 
King's men is their own.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
No one is accusing you of anything. Where did you get the silver spider from? Did you buy it 
from some one?<p>

A man of the Guild of Assassins learned where I keep my modest treasures and wished to open it. 
Having considerable skills, he opened its strange lock but he was struck dead by the trap which 
he had thoughtlessly triggered. When I found the silver spider on his person, I kept it until 
the day I sold it to the King's soldiers.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
They may have believed they could use it to track down the Nighthawks. Was there anything else 
on the dead Nighthawk that could have told you anything about him?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
He had a ticket for passage to Krondor on the Night Crawler, a boat that sometimes harbors in 
Silden. I had no need for it so I threw it away.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I think we have all we need for now, Abuk, but please stay here. We may need to speak to you 
again.<p>

Owyn's pulse quickened as he saw the lone figure approach; but when it became apparent they

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
Abuk, master of locks at your service. How may I be of assistance?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
It appears that you are master of more than locks. What do you know of the Prank's Stone north 
of Romney?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
A tongue wags loose in Silden. I see my enterprises may be silenced.<p> 

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I am interested only in a brass spyglass that you sold to Joftaz in Silden. Tell me about it 
and I will choose to forget about any other thefts you may have participated in. How did you 
come by it?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
A year and twenty ago, I bought a box in Silden from a trader. He told me it would bring me 
great fortune, but I wished only for a strong chest to hold my things and I told him that he 
would be a fool to sell such a box. We haggled and at last I purchased it for ten sovereigns, 
a price that the seller seemed positively glad to receive. I too was pleased with the exchange, 
but began to wonder at the nature of what I had purchased. The chest was possessed of cajunlo.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Cajunlo? What does that mean?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
It was a box of trickery, of magic. Objects would appear in the box, things that I had not 
placed there. Then one day I met a man from Romney and he told me of the true nature of my
chest. When things were lost in a certain place, they came to my box and we could sell those 
items. We decided of course that we would never tell each other more about ourselves so our 
business would be safe should one of us fall into harm.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
And you two would split the profits of whatever appeared in the box. I take it that the brass 
spyglass was one of the items he arranged for you to find?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
It was one of many things.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
The day you got the spyglass, did anything else appear in your box?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
A few things. I keep the things whose value I do not know, so those items which arrived with 
the spyglass are still there as well. I believe there was a note whose contents I do not 
remember.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Where was this box? Is it close-by?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
It lies behind a mountain with two other boxes near Silden and is locked with a special lock. 
You will have to spell out Thorn so that it may be opened. If you do not understand of what I 
speak, you shall when you find the box.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Thorn? We will remember your kindness. Thank you.<p>

slightly with your right hand - a casting gesture. What sort of spell did you just effect?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ABUK:</font>
You observe keenly, but I am not of the magician's breed. I know nothing of cajunlo and yet I 
have this...ability... I may take a seed of knowledge and plant it in the fertile soil of 
another man's mind. I have done as requested, however, I have taught you something of the art 
of picking locks and our deal is still as valid.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Agreed, but a bit of advice if you want to keep your secret hidden. Make sure that your students
keep their eyes on the lock. Perhaps you should arrange it so that sparks flew from it or you 
had it painted in a shiny color. I know that many of the trickers who pose as magicians use that
to keep people from seeing what they are doing.<p>
