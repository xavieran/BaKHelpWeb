A garden was nearby.<p>

Wrinkling his nose at the smell of fresh fertilizer, Owyn pointed out a small cloud of dust that
rose off the roadside. Within the cloud a mushroom shaped man was hard at work, his hoe rising 
and dipping over a row of budding pink potato eyes. Flashing his irrepressible smile, Locklear 
crept up behind the monk.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARC:</font>
I half jumped from out of my robes! Hello there, strangers.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
I hope we aren't disturbing you.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARC:</font>
No, no. I was about to leave the garden anyway. Busy hands set the mind to work you know. On
your way to Sarth?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Perhaps, brother...?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARC:</font>
Brother Marc of Sarth. Glad to meet you. We don't get many illirati here. Books don't seem to 
interest the commoners as much as gold or wenching. But we have scholars enough, all going blind
from reading worm eaten books and a dozen boys scribbling away their youth in our vaults. It is 
an unusual place.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
I've a friend who visited here once. He told me that you worship the god of Knowledge.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARC:</font>
They do say that, yes, and I suppose after a fashion it is true. If there is a question that
can be answered in no other place, your best hope is to look in our vaults.<p>

Do you know anything about spell casting?<p>

I know a little of it, though Brother Dominic knows more about it than I. As soon as he finishes
his studies on Quegian civil codes, I'm certain he would be more than happy to sit down and talk
to you about it. He should be only another two or three months at it I would think.<p>

I'm afraid we don't have two or three months to wait. Why don't we leave the brother alone,
nephew?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARC:</font>
Tsk, tsk, tsk! Now don't discourage the boy from asking questions or he'll become afraid to 
question anything. I think I might have some time to teach him a bit about focusing if you can
spare a few sovereigns, say fifty. Is that acceptable to everyone?<p>

Ah, an enthusiastic student! Delightful. This will be a pleasure to teach.<p>

Owyn blanched.<p>

He had been assigned a simple enough task; cast a telekinetic spell to move his satchel closer 
to him. Instead, his satchel had remained obstinately stationary while hurling Brother Marc 
backwards into his well-tended crops...<p>

"Are you all right?" Owyn gasped. "I didn't mean for that to happen."<p>

"You are still depending on your eyes." Brother Marc sighed, brushing a stalk of corn out of
his face as he struggled to his feet. "Concentrate. If you ever find yourself in a situation 
when you can't see what you're affecting, all the spells in the world will be utterly useless
to you. Instead of trying to see your target, try to feel it. Now let's try this again. I know
you'll learn this eventually..."<p>

"We don't have any more time to waste," Gorath said. "Why don't you pick up your things and 
we can get ready to move, Owyn?" Again on his feet, Brother Marc went to console his 
downcast pupil, patting him reassuringly on the shoulder. "Remember, feel the target. That's
the key. Until then, I suggest you stock up on a good supply of Lewton's Concentrate to get you
through your exercises."<p>

I will have to run up to the Vaults to search for it, but it is a little spell called Flamecast.

Are there any hazards on the road south from here to Krondor? We are in something of a hurry

I haven't heard any complaints from the travellers that have been through here in the past few
weeks. I don't think the mercenaries that stopped by to speak to Brother Dominic said anything 
of it.<p>

Mercenaries? They're not in Quegian press gangs, are they?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARC:</font>
Not to my knowledge, no. These lot landed just south of Questor's View on a ship called the
Foamspinner. As much as they've been up and down the road, I assumed they were in on a shore
leave.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Were there many of them?<p>

Many of them? If you laid them head to foot, I imagine you could walk across the Straits of
Darkness without getting your feet wet. It seems one of those Quegian galleys can carry a small 
village from one place to an other!<p>

There are a few. You might try Babon's Hostel in Questor's View or the old Bywater Inn. If it

been trying his hand at dream sendings and I've not had a good night's sleep in weeks.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Dream sendings?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARC:</font>
It's a way to send messages over long distances. Only certain magicians have the talent for it.
Whoever it is, they can't be too far away because his images are fairly strong.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
What do they seem to be trying to say?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARC:</font>
I'm not certain. The images are too disjointed, though now I think of it, I thought I had seen
your elf friend's face before. Now I know why. His face was in the sendings.<p>

It's fine with me, but it's Brother Anthony you may have to convince. He doesn't like strangers
wandering around down there without supervision. We have a number of rare and valuable books and
it would be the worst kind of tragedy to lose them to a casual browser. I'll warn you though,
you may have difficulty finding what it is you want. Many of the books have never been cataloged
and unless you know very specifically what you are looking for either by the scribe's name or
the title of the work, you might not find anything that will be of any value to you.<p>

Would you have anything up in the Abbey about the Guild of Death? As I recall from when I

how it is that some of them become Black Slayers.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARC:</font>
No need to search the vaults. Many of them worship Kahooli, who, occasionally, will grant them 
a near-deathless state in exchange for total dedication to the god of revenge. It took us a long
while to learn the spells that keep a Nighthawk from rising from death.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
There is a spell? We thought you had to hack the body up and burn it to bits.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARC:</font>
An unpleasant solution, and time consuming. After the Great Rising was over and the moredhel
went home, we were able to work with the priests of Lims-Kragma to create a spell to keep a
Nighthawk from becoming a Black Slayer or to keep a Black Slayer down once he was slain. If you 
would like, I can probably dig the spell up in the Vaults. Are you interested? There will be a 
hundred sovereign fee.<p>

shomshone, Four-Hands Down, and chess as far as our cataloging system is concerned. They are
all still considered just games at this point."<p>

waste of time, you haven't seen this particular scroll."<p>

"Pardon?" James blinked at the parchment, then at the priest. "What do you mean?"<p>

"What I mean is that the scroll in your lap is known as the Saaha Bela'hi, the Victor's Soul.
It is perhaps the rarest and most valuable writing on the subject of chess ever put to paper.
Unfortunately, it is also exceedingly rare. I get chills just thinking what we had to do to get 
it. This is our only translation available and it was the only work I could find with reference
to Abbar's Turn. Read it and quickly, before Brother Anthony finds I've taken it."<p>

James smiled and unrolled the scroll, studying all the details of the move carefully. Once he
had absorbed the material, he produced the gold he owed Brother Marc.<p>

"I promise I won't forget your efforts, brother."<p>

The priest nodded, then snatched up the scroll.<p>

"Let's just hope Brother Anthony can."<p>

As I said before, it is a special request and it would take me away from other duties. I am
sorry if my price is inconvenient.<p>

Brother Marc hove into view. Wielding a hoe in his hammy fists, he gestured to James with it.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARC:</font>
Glad to see you, but I'd advise a bit of distance at the moment. There's been an outbreak of 
the Quegian Fever at Sarth and I'm not sure if I'm carrying it or not.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
How could you not know? Every five year old boy in Tiburn could recognize the warning signs.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARC:</font>
In Tiburn perhaps they could, but as I might point out, this is not Tiburn.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
I thought the Brothers of Ishap at Sarth were supposed to know everything.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARC:</font>
Perhaps we will someday, Ishap willing, but let me tell you something. When I was about your
age, I discovered a miraculous thing about planting. For years I had kept a journal about the
things that I had learned as I had scratched in the dirt. One day - shortly after my acceptance 
into the Brotherhood of Ishap - I was going over some of my notes and I made a miraculous 
discovery. It would change the way that farmers grew crops forever! I was so excited that I
decided I would share this great secret with the world and I padded off to the nearest town with
my journal proudly stuck under my arm.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Did the farmers use your technique?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARC:</font>
Oh, yes...and they had been using it for over three hundred years! My humble tricks were
childish speculation next to what the farmers already knew. My point is this: if our brethren
in Malac's Cross have something that they consider common knowledge, it might remain uncommon
knowledge to the rest of us for years because they assume we should already know it. Like any
other portable good, Knowledge must be collected and given out. That, my friends, is the primary
reason that Sarth exists.<p>

Don't get too close. As I said earlier, I may be carrying the fever and I don't want to make 
any of you ill. Perhaps you want me to look up something for you in Sarth's library?<p>

Brother Marc hove into view. Still wielding a hoe in his hammy fists, he gestured to Owyn
with it.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARC:</font>
I would advise you to stay well clear of Sarth. Our Brother Dominic has fallen ill with Quegian
Fever.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Why didn't anyone treat the fever before it became serious?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARC:</font>
None of us knew he was infected until this morning. When he woke this morning he reported to
the brotherhood's herbalist that he was experiencing dizziness.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
It's one of the early signs of the fever, but I wouldn't be overly concerned. Quegian Fever is
rarely fatal to adults.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARC:</font>
It's not the fever's primary effects that concern me. As Keeper of the Gates, Brother Dominic is
the greatest wielder of the magical arts among us. Should he begin to hallucinate, he may lose
his capacity to discern between real and imagined threats. He might view other members of the 
brotherhood as enemies or perhaps he will see a threat in the outside world. We know from Pug
of Stardock that things of this nature can occur when magicians fall ill... <p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
No one can break his fever?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARC:</font>
I am sure the herbalist will do what he can, but our best hope resides in Brother Dominic's
iron will. Until such time his fever breaks, the Abbey of Ishap at Sarth will be a fearfully
dangerous place and I would advise against going any closer. Was there something you needed from
the Abbey?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
My grandfather used to tell me stories about the chambers beneath Sarth that he said were once
part of a rich dwarven mine. He called it the Mac Boogalan...Borgu...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARC:</font>
The Mac Bourgalan Dok I believe it was called, yes. At one time it was quite an impressive
emerald mine.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
He suggested that there still might be tunnels that connect with those directly beneath the
Abbey. If you have any of the old dwarven maps or deeds, we might be able to get in through the 
old mine.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARC:</font>
Unfortunately, those maps are not in the hands of the Brothers of Sarth at the moment. We gave
it over to the assistant tax collector who lives in Eggley, a fellow named Stellan. I understand
that there was some confusion in regards to how much the Abbey could be taxed because of it's
connection to those old mines. If you speak to him, I am sure he could show you those documents.
At least it sounds like a way we may be able to re-enter the abbey!<p>

Of Macros, no. About Macros, I know we have a few of them in the Vaults, most concerning the
legends about the Villa Beata while he was living on Sorcerer's Isle. We might also have a few
things by him in there, but I couldn't be certain without checking.<p>

We'll try our best to find a solution, but we have another important matter to attend to and
very little time. What happens in the circumstance that this Brother Dominic begins to
hallucinate?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MARC:</font>
I cannot say with any certitude. My assumption is that he will activate the mystic defenses. If
that occurs, there may be no access to the Abbey at all.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
At least it doesn't sound as if he will pose a life-threatening situation... If we come across
anything that I think could be of help, I promise we will return as soon as we can. In exchange,
do us a favor and stay out of Dominic's path until this problem is solved. Goodbye brother.<p>
