ALE
</font><br>
The contents of the cup were typical of the ale found in most of the Kingdom, a 
dark brown mixture with a seedy scum floating on the surface. All in all, not 
the best of drinks but one that could induce a mellower outlook when life grew 
too stressful.

His curiosity sufficiently piqued, Owyn popped open the half-gallon cask and 
inhaled deeply. Immediately his senses reeled as the heady cinnamon-like aroma 
assaulted him. Keshian Ale!

Locklear wiggled the small cask's cork loose and upended it, unmindful of the fact that 
it was spilling down his face and neck as he drank. Wiping the excess from his 
mouth with the back of his hand, he smiled unrepentantly.
"Good stuff, that Keshian Ale."

ALTHAFAIN'S ICER
</font><br>
Frost encysted the crystalline point of the magician's tool, faint tendrils of 
mist trailing its arc as Owyn waved it back and forth. If not for the engraved 
words on its handle, he might not have guessed its purpose: <i>For magical 
treatment of a blade. Althafain the artificer</i>.

As Gorath slid the tip of the magical artifact down the length of the sword, a 
glittering blue frost formed on the blade. Assuming his victim wasn't using 
some form of Sarigsbane on his armor, the enchantment would make any wound 
done with the sword incredibly painful.

AMULET OF THE UPRIGHT MAN

Owyn looked at the medallion skeptically. In Krondor similar amulets were sold 
as fool's trinkets, ornaments that seemed in all respects like true gold but 
were clever fakes run up by unscrupulous magicians. Checking the reverse side, 
he noted an inscription to Banath, the god of luck and of thieves.

ARMORER'S HAMMER

Gorath flipped the armorer's hammer head over handle several times, catching it 
before it fell to the ground. As a weapon it would be entirely useless, its mass 
insufficient to cause injury, but it was an extremely handy tool to use to 
repair armor plates which were wedged loose during combat.

AVENTURINE

Uncorking the mouth of the oilskin, James poured out a small portion of the gold 
flecked lacquer into his palm and examined it. Named after a type of impure 
brown glass common in Rillanon, it was an ideal resin to use on crossbow strings 
when they began to lose their cohesiveness.

BAG OF GRAIN

Owyn could see the reason bartering for raw goods was beginning to disappear as 
the Kingdom of the Isles began to mint their own currency. Carrying around raw 
grain as a means to make purchases was far too cumbersome.

BESSY MAULER
</font><br>
The crossbow type had become legendary since the end of the Riftwar. Replicated 
from a model discovered in the Northlands, the draw was impossible to set 
barehanded and required a lever called a goatsfoot be used to span its deadly 
draw. Fortunately, the crossbow had the device attached.

BRASS SPYGLASS
</font><br>
A relatively simple device, the spyglass was a cylinder of brass fitted with a 
large glass lens on one end and another, smaller lens on the opposite end. While 
spyglasses were used to spot distant objects, James suspected this one had been 
rendered useless by the cracks in the larger lens.

Undaunted by the spyglass' cracked lenses, James raised the nautical tool to his

if he saw something beyond the world before him. By some facility he was able to 
see objects that were hidden from his view.

Slicing air with the weapon, Gorath made a few passes at an imaginary foe.

Turning over the coarsely woven cloth in his hands, he examined the blotches of 
yellow mold that seemed remarkably like a human face. It was probable the linen 
had been a burial shroud, the face imprinted upon it as the unknown man's flesh 
had dissolved into moldering corruption.

CATAPULT GEAR

In ways the part resembled the gears used in crossbows, but where he associated 
the moving parts of hand-held weapons with precision, the catapult's axle gear

Owyn yelped as the tin key's serrated edge dug into the fleshy part of his palm. 
Angered, he held the key up for closer investigation. Evidently the key had been 
fashioned in a hurry, its edges left jagged and its face decorated only with a 
small wave shaped sigil. Whoever had made the key had not intended it for use on 
a daily basis.

CLERICAL OILCLOTH

Distributed once a year from the Temple of Tith, oilcloths were often resold by 
the poor to any who would buy. The oil which was soaked into the fiber had 
numerous qualities, though it was best known for its magical effects when 
smeared on edged weapons or on armor.

A dark sheen appeared as Locklear applied the holy oilcloth, rubbing the metal until 
its surface drank up some of the residue. While its effects could be countered 
if his opponent had used the same oil, it at least ensured that he would be on 
even footing with anyone hostile that he met.

COLTARI POISON

Famed on Kelewan as a deadly slow poison, Coltari Poison would be of no use on a 
blade, its effects too delayed to be of any use against an armed opponent. It 
could, how ever, be applied to foods or drinks to strike down an unsuspecting 
victim.

The staff suggested a great deal about its parent culture. Artificed with as

Grabbing a quarrel at one end after the head and at the other end short of the

VIRTUE KEY
</font><br>
"This is a virtue key or I'm a gwali's uncle," James said with a grin, tapping 
the dorsal shaped head. "Originally these keys were only made for chastity 
belts, but in the last hundred years or so they've expanded the use of the 
design. The locks this will open protect very valuable items."

WAANI
</font><br>
Made of a glazed metal, three concentric rings encircled the mushroom shaped 
device's base, through which was visible a globe of glass that flashed periodic 
bursts of white light. While the design was Tsurani, it could only have been 
made on Midkemia, the price of metals too prohibitive on Kelewan to allow such 
an extravagant device to be built.

WARD OF RALEN-SHEB
</font><br>
Even without looking at the key, Pug sensed something abnormal about it. "The 
key is...pulsing," he said. "The inscriptions on the haft have aspects about 
them that look elven, but parts also appear moredhel. Whatever it is, I have the 
feeling it predates the Kingdom, the Northlands or even Elvandar itself."

WEEDWALKERS

The strange elven footwear was far too dainty to suit his tastes. Dyed bright 
green and trimmed with a thin cord of gold, they were obviously intended as 
something to be worn within boots or moccasins.

WHETSTONE

Gorath ran his forefinger lightly across the rough grain of the whetstone. While 
it wouldn't last him long, it would be useful in keeping the edge of his sword 
from deteriorating.

USE [if ineffective]
</font><p>
It wasn’t as bad as he'd thought.<br>
Not wishing to make the error of a rash decision, he double checked the [Sword] for 
anything he'd missed, but it was in as good repair as he knew how to make it.

WOODEN CHEST
</font><br>
Roughly the size of a baked loaf of bread, the wooden chest seemed 
extraordinarily heavy, as if something made of solid lead was contained within, 
but there were no visible marks on the miniature chest to indicate what it had 
been crafted to hold.

USE
</font><br>
James cracked open the box's lid.<br>
Engulfed in a coruscating geyser of light which fountained from the interior of 
the small box, he shouted as he felt himself shot into the air like a crossbow 
bolt into the blue.

WOODEN STAFF
</font><br>
While his woodworking skills wouldn't give his rivals reason to quit their 
professions, the crafter's staffsmanship was exceptional. From the bole of a yew 
tree, he had fashioned a staff which looked as if it could be used magically as 
well as a fighting weapon.

WYVERN'S EGG
</font><br>
If not for the regularity of its faceted surface the wyvern's egg could have 
passed as a peculiar geode, a quartzite anomaly created by the whims of nature. 
As Owyn touched it, however, there could be no doubt that something lived within 
its fragile shell.
