On December 1, 1995, I uploaded a few files as a test. This test has now
become the BAK HELP WEB, composed of approximately 2400 files (1100 html
files and 1300 gifs), taking 22 Megabytes of disk space, and used by at
least 300 visitors every day. Below I will attempt to set out the History
and Credits.<p>
</font>
In May 1996 the Web finally had a definite shape. In the meantime many
users had offered invaluable help by pointing out errors, and suggesting
changes and additions. I can't possibly name them all, but the following
were extremely helpful:<p>

My friend <font color=#00cc00 size=+1>Gunnar Th. Eggertsson</font>, who was responsible for my interest in
the game (after I bought it in Copenhagen as a present to him), and
then helped me get through it alive.<p>

<font color=#00cc00 size=+1>Kirk Woll</font>, who was the first person to link to my page from his REF page.<p>

And a lot of others, far too many to mention, who shared their knowledge,
in the early days.<br>
I would especially like to thank:<p>
<font color=#00cc00>
Jay Lou,
Jeff Chuan,
James Allan,
Alex R. Moffatt,
Daniel Gudlat,
Gary Wilcox,
Caleb Lee,<br>
Bill (Prince of Chaos),
Matt Jepsen,
Glen Emo,
Rory Kostman,
Paun Bogdan Cristian,<br>
Matthew Ross,
Daria Thomas,
Henrik Salomonsson, and
Svapan Makadia.<p>

In June 1996 I received my first letter from Jay Sevara, "BAK savant extraordinaire". His first
letter was almost 100 pages long, and totally changed my mind about what I had been doing for the
last few months. Ultimately, our correspondence amounted to approximately 2000 printed pages.
Jay introduced me to to HEX EDITORS, and taught me how to use them. I was fascinated, and spent
the next 8 months delving into and analyzing BAK saved-game-files, until I basically knew how
the game worked, and how these files could be edited in order to change any aspect of the game.<p>

In the Spring of 1997, at the end of this period, I had collected a huge mountain of data. But
I basically had no idea what to do with it - it was just TOO MUCH. I created a huge database
of enemy information (stats, inventories, etc.), and another database of Cache Contents, but my mind boggled at the idea of presenting
this monster. I had also compiled a huge and unwieldy file of Shop info, which would have taken
me ages to present. I was basically at a loss.<p>
</font>

Miracles happen. Believe me. During this period I was contacted by three different persons,
who later became instrumental in making the BAK Web what it is today:<p>

<font color=#00cc00 size=+1>
Jeremy Martz (Volante)</font> patiently created the basic templates for the individual Shop Pages
from my data. His efforts gave me the impetus to create the Shop Web. Still later, Jeremy's
work saved me a lot of time in re-designing the individual Moredhel Chest pages.<p>

During this time I also started my correspondence with <font color=#00cc00 size=+1>Bob Freimuth</font>.
There is no way for
me to express my thanks to Bob in a few words. He is basically a co-author of this Web by
now. First, his knowledge of maths and scientific testing has been invaluable to me. Together
we have set up thousands of BAK tests, and Bob has helped me to compute the results. Second,
he is a very good critic. Whenever I have a problem with presentation and lay-out, he is always 
there to comment on and criticize my methods. Third, Bob spent countless hours screen-capturing
hundreds of overhead maps from the game, and joining them seamlessly together. I must admit 
that I had no idea what to do with these images, at first. But in the end, they became the 
<font color=#cc0000>MAP WEB</font>, when combined with my Enemy and Cache databases.<p>

During this period, I also received my first letter from <font color=#00cc00 size=+1>Fredrik Eriksson</font>. He simply asked if I
had any info on hex-editing Saved Games. You bet! It then turned out that Fredrik was a programmer.
The result: <font color=#00cc00>BAKHACKER</font> - probably the greatest game-editor ever written. Ever since, Fredrik has
been tirelessly improving <font color=#00cc00>BH</font>. The current version (8.2) is surely a state-of-the-art game editor,
at least I haven't seen anything like it, ever. It must be mentioned that the <font color=#cc0000>MAP WEB</font> wouldn't
exist without Fredrik. While I was creating it, Fredrik patiently listened to my frequent cries for help,
and added many new features to BaKHacker, as soon as I needed them in order to make the job 
possible. Thanks to Fredrik you can be sure that the <font color=#cc0000>MAB WEB</font> shows every single Bush in
the game (and then some)!<p>

August, 1999: The BAK Help Web has gained a new benefactor and friend,
<font color=#00cc00 size=+1>Paul Combetta</font>. Not only
has he offered to host the ZIPPED BAK WEB, but also enabled me to add SOUNDS to the TEXT WEB.
Thanks to Paul, you can now hear all the NPCS' introductions! I suspect Paul is keeping some more surprises
up his sleeve, but I won't make any guesses. We'll see...<p>

<font color=#009999> 
I have also received letters from
John Cutter, <a href="../../../external.html?link=http://members.aol.com/nealiios/nealhome.htm"><font color=#009999>Neal Hallford</font></a> and Timothy Strelchun. John designed and produced the game,
Neal wrote it, and Timothy did a lot of the programming. These letters are private, so
I won't publish them here. You'll just have to take my word for it: they are extremely positive,
even flattering. Am I proud? Of course I am!<p>
</font>

Finally, I would like to thank the countless people who have visited the BAK Web, and
sent me letters. I have received approximately 10.000 letters since the opening of the Web
in December, 1995. I have always tried to reply, if a reply was called for, and will continue
doing so. I have received hundreds of suggestions, which have been added to the Web, but it
would be quite impossible to give credit to every single person who has helped making the BAK
Web what it is today. I send my heartfelt thanks to all of you.<p>
