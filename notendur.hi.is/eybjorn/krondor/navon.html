Locklear was weary.<p>

When he had first left Krondor to study under Captain Moyiet for a while, he had thought it 
would be a simple matter of soldiering for a few months and then returning home to Land's End or
back to Arutha's court. But for more months than it seemed he could count, he had been ambling 
around the Kingdom and the Northlands, accomplishing little that he felt would be of value to 
Prince Arutha. What was more, now he had Gorath and the squire from Tiburn in tow and a 
responsibility to get them all alive to Krondor.<p>

Feeling a tug at his sleeve, he revived from his woolgathering. Beside him, Owyn was pointing at
an advancing figure. <p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NAVON:</font>
So far from the Prince's court, I'm surprised any from your part of the world even knew Kenting 
Rush existed. Have you come for business or pleasure?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Chance has had a greater part in delivering us here than anything else. Actually, we are only 
travelling on our way from LaMut. We have a trading appointment in Romney.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NAVON:</font>
Ah, the city of guilds. I've heard that there is some difficulty there. Something to do with a 
dispute between the Riverpullers and the Glazer's Guilds. I've even heard rumors that the Guild 
of Assassins has had some involvement, but I could hardly credit it. Hopefully the affair will 
come to a peaceful resolution soon enough... You will excuse me for staring, but it has been 
some time since I have seen an elf in these parts. It is even more passing uncommon I should 
meet one so heavily armored.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Go...Thorgath is working with us to negotiate a new trading deal of elven goods in the Eastern 
Kingdom. He trades in armor, so it is easier to transport it this way rather than carrying it 
in a satchel...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NAVON:</font>
Ingenious, no doubt. Thorgath, you say. The name sounds...familiar in a way. Perhaps we have 
met before?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
We have never met. You are mistaken.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NAVON:</font>
Of course, I will accept your word on the matter. I must have only met someone who resembled
you... To other matters. As you are all visitors to Kenting Rush, and visitors are also good business, 
are there any things I may be of assistance with?<p>

Navon Du Sandau, a merchant they had met in Kenting Rush before.<p>

ask you about it later? We have a few things we need to be attending to elsewhere.<p>

sovereigns. Deal?<p>

As Navon played out his moves using an odd assortment of stones, it was apparent the play would 
be devastating if used against an aggressive opponent. "Think you can remember all of that?" 
Navon asked, brushing the dirt from his hands. "Not a problem," James <font color=#999999>(sic)</font> replied, dumping Navon's

What reason would Count Corvalis have to dislike you, Navon?<p>

Perhaps he is an over protective father, who is to say? I'm frankly surprised he hasn't hired a 
band of Nighthawks to have me killed. I ask too many questions for his tastes.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
You think he has connections to the Guild of Assassins?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NAVON:</font>
It's a well-known fact he is surrounded by Nighthawks. They guard his house, his lands, Cavall 
Keep. When his daughter Ugyne and I have time together, we are always followed by assassins, 
though they never wear their guild clothing while working for the Count.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Why don't any of the local people do anything about it? Surely they object to having the 
Nighthawks loose in the area.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NAVON:</font>
They look the other way. As long as none of them are being killed, it doesn't concern them. I'm 
sure that's even true in Krondor.<p>

James sniffed the air.<p>

While for the better part of the last hour he had been trying to piece together the details of 
the murder at the Black Sheep Tavern, something else had begun nagging at him, elusive as the 
names of all the Mockers he'd once known. It had only been after a few minutes of consideration 
that he'd realized what it was that was distracting him.<p>

"Do you smell anything odd?" he asked Gorath. Struck by the oddity of smelling jasmine in the 
open, he could spot no natural flora that could account for the scent. But while searching, he 
thought he spotted someone moving down the road towards them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NAVON:</font>
There is little here to give event enough to warrant visitors from the Bitter Sea, and if that 
weren't enough, it seems we have guests as well from Elvandar. Welcome to Kenting Rush.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
This may sound a strange question, but a moment ago I thought I smelled spice...jasmine to be 
exact. Does it grow near here?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NAVON:</font>
You have a keen nose. Unfortunately it isn't local. I deal in spices as well as a number of 
other imported goods. I've just returned from a lengthy trip into Kesh and I am afraid the scent
clings a bit to the clothes.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
But you've only just come up the road. I've been smelling it for some while.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NAVON:</font>
I am told the scent carries. There is a bit of a wind today. So...as you are travellers in the 
area and dealing with the natives can sometimes be difficult, is there any way I can be of some 
assistance to you?<p>

Do you know anything about the accident that killed Neville Corvalis? <p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NAVON:</font>
It was a peculiar accident if I understand the tavernkeeper at the Duck's Head in Cavall Keep. 
Seems this Sandau fellow was something of a drunkard who had a reputation for building inferior 
structures. I find it hard to believe the Count would have entrusted the construction to such a 
man, but surely he couldn't have meant for the wine cellar to collapse?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
You think the Count intended to have the wine cellar collapse? For what purpose?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NAVON:</font>
I've heard the Count suspected his son of something terrible, but... The Count and I have
enough bad blood between us. I don't wish to say anything else that may jeopardize my suit with 
Ugyne. As the things I have related to you are rumor, I would appreciate it if you didn't tell

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I'm not familiar with the worshippers of Kahooli. Generally speaking, Banath and Astalon are 
more popular with the people in Krondor.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NAVON:</font>
It's difficult to publicly worship a god dedicated to revenge, almost as hard to worship, I 
imagine, as the goddess of death. People naturally assume when you begin pilgrimage on a regular
basis that you have a score you wish to settle, which, more often than not, is true. They blind 
themselves to the fact that while Kahooli is sometimes called The Pursuer, he is also known as 
the Judge of Truth. When you can't get justice anywhere else, people turn to Kahooli.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
And who did you wish to avenge?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NAVON:</font>
Ha, well, myself naturally. It has been some time since I have been to the Temple, however. My 
problem pretty much solved itself and then I didn't need divine intervention anymore and so...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
So it's easier to stay away than to pay the tithe. Do you remember any of their codes of piety?
The priest mentioned them and I was curious what they were. <p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NAVON:</font>
I tried to forget them...hmm...I can only remember the first one and it had something to do 
with subjugation of the will if I remember correctly. When you join the Temple, you have to 
renounce all ties to King and Kingdom. That's why you'll find that there aren't any nobility in 
the Temple. Of course, when you can command a private army, why bother?<p>

Ugyne Corvalis told us she loaned you a book about the Guarda Revanche. Might I borrow it back 
from you?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NAVON:</font>
Unfortunately I don't have it on my person. I left it at home.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
At home. Are you certain you didn't misplace it anywhere?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NAVON:</font>
As it is a loan, I keep it in a very safe place where it cannot become damaged.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Somewhere like Cavall Run? I have always wondered what the leader of the Nighthawks might be 
like and now it seems we meet face to face.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NAVON:</font>
Interesting conclusion. How do you arrive at it?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
We found the Abbot's Journal in Cavall Run...after we had a slight run in with a few of your 
men. You mentioned earlier that you thought that Count Corvalis might have killed his son, but 
as I recall the body was never found and you have displayed an unerring interest in the Corvalis
family. The kind of interest that a son might display in a family from whom he has been separated?
Did you kill yourself or was that your father's doing?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NAVON:</font>
I believe congratulations are in order. You've accomplished what my father, his men, and the 
King's detachment from Bas-Tyra were unable to achieve. You are a clever man.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Why the Nighthawks, Navon? Or shall I call you Neville?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NAVON:</font>
Suppose for a moment a woman bears her husband a strong, attractive, intelligent son. As he 
grows, he shows every sign that he will make a fine man but somehow different. Suppose then at 
about age eleven, this boy's father discovers the boy is not in fact his son, but the son of 
another man - a bastard. Among the common folk it would be no great crime, but supposing the 
fooled father was noble. That would change things, wouldn't it? What if the real father had 
gotten the child upon the indiscreet noblesse as a means to gain power?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
You became a threat to the succession so the Count opted to eliminate you. He locked you in the 
wine cellar but you found your way into the care of the Nighthawks.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NAVON:</font>
Yes. They had come to Cavall to regroup following their rout by Prince Arutha and initially 
they thought to ransom me. When they realized the Count wouldn't pay for my return, they 
decided to kill me, but I convinced them I had mental powers.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
The spyglass?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NAVON:</font>
It has been useful on more than one occasion. It gave me control of the Nighthawks, and it also 
allowed me to predict my father's moves. He believed I was dead of course, but the appearance of
Navon du Sandau years later made him nervous. He believed I might know about the scandal and 
would tell what I know. That wouldn't have been any fun. Far better to torture your murderer than 
to simply kill him, don't you think? He became most agitated when I torched the family's keep. It 
was a shame to lose it, but a necessary sacrifice.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
So you could have control of the caverns underneath the keep. A perfect hiding place for you and
your men and an excellent rendezvous with the moredhel with whom you were dealing.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NAVON:</font>
The tunnels were extensive and relatively unknown by any outside of the family. Besides, as 
husband to Ugyne, I would eventually have been it's rightful master. Not that I would have 
conjugated the marriage, Ishap forbid. She would have died some unpleasant death on our wedding 
night. Tragedy seems to plague the Corvalis family. Between the family fortune and Delekhan's 
deposits with Isunatus in Cavall Keep, I could have run the Nighthawks indefinitely.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I want the key, Navon. Hand it over.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NAVON:</font>
Perhaps you would like to take it from me. Since you first arrived in Romney looking for the 
Nighthawks, I've been watching you Seigneur James. For years I've heard tales about Jimmy the 
Hand from the men who survived your Nighthawk purges in Krondor. They told very impressive tales
about you. Now it's time to see if you can match a true Nighthawk in combat.<p> 

</td><td valign=top>
<b>
<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
On behalf of the Temple of Kahooli, I inform you that you are now excommunicate. They formally 
have renounced their ties to the Guild of Assassins and will announce the identities of all who 
belong to it. The Nighthawks are finished, Navon. Despite their request I murder you, I will let
you live if you tell me where I can find the moredhel communiques concerning the attack.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NAVON:</font>
A lie, Seigneur, and you know it. You'll have my guts for killing those men in Romney whether I 
tell you or not. Since you first arrived looking for the Nighthawks, I' ve been watching you.
