This is probably the most elusive Quest in the game, basically because it is confined to
the Western Sectors of Zone 5. The game can easily be finished without visiting these Sectors.

In order to INITIATE the Grain Quest you must talk to Risa, the High Priestess of Dala.
Her food stores are empty. If you can obtain, and bring back a Bag of Grain, she will reward
you.<p>

The Grain Quest can be INITIATED in Chapter 1, but it can only be PERFORMED in Chapters 2 and 3.
If you initiate it in Chapter 1 (by going to the Temple of Dala), and then talk to Squire Phillip
(North of LaMut), you can ask him about GRAIN, and he will offer a valuable clue. You can also
initiate the Quest in Chapters 2 and 3.<p>

In Chapter 2 Squire  Phillip will be found close to the Temple, performing a private function. At this
stage you can also ask him about HIGHCASTLE.

Furthermore, there's a Book in the SARTH Library, which adds some color to this Quest:<p>

<font color=#cccc00>
"Blessed of Dala be the daughters of Flendel Halfgate; so named Thea, Andrea, Gena,
Sara, Kira, and Larissa; who in good mercy hath been rightworthy and true to the goddess,
having provided much needed leather goods, grain, and entertainment for the woefully poor in
their hour of need. From this day in the second year of the reign of good king Lyam the first,
forever shall your issue be watched over by the fortunes of the goddess."<p>
</font>

If you've visited the Temple of Dala in Chapter 1, you can easily TELEPORT here in Chapter 2
(Ruthia, Lims-Kragma), or Chapter 3 (Banath, Kahooli). Otherwise you'll just have to WALK.<p>

A Tuning Fork is needed in order to finish this Quest, so make sure you have TWO - one to
deal with all the Trolls, and another one to give away. (If you've fought the Nighthawks
East of the Temple of Ruthia, you should be holding one NOW.)<p>

If you haven't already done so, visit the Temple, talk to the Priestess and accept the 
Grain Quest. There are three large groups of Moredhel Warriors nearby
(see Chapter 1 Walhthrough).<p>

The wordlocked chests East of the temple (FUTURE, COALS, SECRET) contain mostly weapons,
and the Trap guarding them is easy: Just shove the Solid Crystals in front of the Blasters.<p>

<img src="tunifork.gif" width=88 height=64 align=left>Larissa Halfgate's
house is the first house you come across North-East of the Temple.
If you can open her Barn, she will reward you with a Tuning Fork [4].
Strength of 30 is needed to open the Barn. If Gorath's Strength isn't up to it,
have him drink Fadamor's Formula (which you may have picked up from the RUST Chest
near Darkmoor). Hold on to the Tuning Fork - you'll need to give it away soon.<p>

Don't miss the Goblin Sticker buried in a Mound of Dirt North of Larissa's Barn.
Now head East. Near the next house you'll have to fight 4 Moredhel Warriors
<font color=#009900>[Combat 06]</font>. One of them has a Tuning Fork [60]. If you
don't already have the Tuning Fork [60] picked up from the Nighthawks East of the
Temple of Ruthia, make sure you get this one.<p>

<img src="tr.gif" width=92 height=93 align=left hspace=10>
West of Eldpoint you'll have to deal with a group of 3 Trolls <font color=#009900>
[Combat 15]</font>. Another group of 5 Trolls <font color=#009900>[Combat 05]</font> is waiting
East of Eldpoint (unless you've already killed them in Chapter 1). Fight them, if you
feel up to it, but Trolls rarely carry any valuable items. Out of
these 8 Trolls, only two carry Items: 89 Gold Sovereigns, and Flame Root Oil [1]. Better
use the Tuning Fork to get rid of them the easy way.<p>

A house in Eldpoint contains Weedwalkers. East of Eldpoint you will enter the Highcastle
Sector of Zone 5. This is quite an interesting area to explore, but for the time being 
just stick to the Main Road. Soon you will spot a Locked Chest South of the Road. It contains
a small treasure of Gold and Gemstones, but you'll need a Lockpicking Skill of 95! James can
possibly manage this, if his Skill has reached 65, and if he's holding TWO Amulets of the
Upright Man! At the crossroads South of Highcastle you'll meet 4 Trolls <font color=#009900>
[Combat 02]</font> (unless you've killed them in Chapter 1). One of them has Silverthorn [3], but you'll probably want to use the
Tuning Fork to get rid of them fast. Now go on East, and enter the Wolfram Sector.<p>

<img src="leggings.gif" width=88 height=64 align=left>
A group of 4 Trolls <font color=#009900>[Combat 11]</font> is waiting here. One of the
Trolls has a Whetstone, nothing else. Where would you be without your trusty Tuning Fork?
A bit farther East you will come to a house South of the Road. Two more Halfgate sisters
live here, Gena and Andrea. In exchange for a Tuning Fork, they will give you Leather Leggings.
So now you know why it's better to have TWO of the dratted things!<p>

<img src="baggrain.gif" width=88 height=53 align=left>
This is as far as you need to go in order to finish the Grain Quest. Return to the crossroads
South of Highcastle, and turn left (South-East). 3 more Trolls (carrying no items) await you
here, so be grateful for that extra Tuning Fork. South of this Combat you will soon come to
Sara Halfgate's house. She will give you a Bag of Grain in exchange for the Leather Leggings.<p>

In order to finish the Quest all you need to do is to return to the Temple of Dala. The priestess
will give you a choice of adding 25 points to ONE CHARACTER'S Defense Skill, or 10 points to ALL
CHARACTERS' Defense Skills.<p>

<font color=#cccc00>
TIP: If DEFENSE ONLY is Selected, you will gain 37.5 Points for one
Character, 15 Points for all three.<p></font>

You can now teleport (or walk) back to whereever you came from, and resume
the Main Quest of Chapter 2. But wait! Since you're here, why not explore some more?<p>

<center>
<font color=#00cccc size=+3>HIGHCASTLE</font><br>
<img src="hcastle.gif" width=284 height=109></center><p>

The Highcastle area is quite rewarding, but it is easy to lose one's bearings here, so please
familiarize yourself with the simplified Road Map below.<p>

<img src="highsmpl.gif" width=269 height=243 align=left>
Go to Highcastle. Talk to Baron Kevin, and accept a mini-Quest.
Locate a group of 5 Goblins on the Wyke Road <font color=#009900>[Combat 03]</font>. One of them
has a Spynote which will earn you 200 Gold from the Baron. You
will run into 4 Trolls <font color=#009900>[Combat 13]</font>, but since they don't hold any items,
just use the Tuning Fork. At a nearby house you will learn of three Moredhel Chests to
the South (YESTERDAY, BREATH and BARK). There's a Trap here, so take care:<p>

Push the Middle Transparent Crystal in front of the Rightmost Blaster.
Then push the Left Transparent Crystal in front of the Middle Blaster.
The way out is now clear, unless you make a stupid move.<br clear=all><p> 
 
Note the clickable HOTSPOT near the Highcastle Sunset. This will take you to Highcastle Gorge
and back again, and the journey will take SIX DAYS and cost you as many Rations! Pretty useless?
Yes, but there's a devious way to utilize this, if you have PLENTY of Rations. The game adds ONE
POINT to your Maximum Health and Stamina every 30 days. This trip allows you make time fly! At a
cost of 5 Rations per Character, you can add one point to your Maximum Health and Stamina as often
as you want (or can afford). Think about it ...<p>

<a name=dim>
<center>
<a href="dim.html">MAP OF ROAD TO DIMWOOD AREA</a><p>
</center>

West of Sara Halfgate's house there are 5 Trolls <font color=#009900>[Combat 14]</font>, carrying
nothing. Note the Bushes nearby - they contain Rations and Restoratives. Farther West you will find
a Shop (Scavenger's Meet) and 4 more Trolls <font color=#009900>[Combat 04]</font> carrying no items.
Follow the Road to the South. There are no Enemies here until Chapter 3. Locate three Moredhel Chests,
GAUNTLET, HORSEMAN, and BOTTLE. The BOTTLE Chest contains the STEELFIRE Scroll and some precious
Fadamor's Formula. This road leads to the North Sector of Dimwood (Zone 7). Since this is not easily
accessible in Chapter 1, you may be tempted to access it now:<p> 

<a name=ndimw>
<center>
<a href="ndimw.html">MAP OF  DIMWOOD (NORTH)</a><p>
</center>


On entering, you will have to fight a group of 3 Witch Hags and 2 Moredhel Warriors
<font color=#009900>[Combat 19]</font>.<br>
<img src="ru.gif" width=92 height=93 align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>
If you study the MAP of this area, you will be
able to pick up some treasures without running into any Enemies. The SHOES Chest contains
a Glory Hand. The STOVE Chest has the NIGHTFINGERS Scroll. The THISTLE Chest holds the
BLACK NIMBUS Scroll. If you fight the Rusalka by the waterfall, the Mound of Dirt
will yield the RIVER SONG Scroll <font color=#999999>(and STRENGTH DRAIN in Version 1.01)</font>.
<p> 

<img src="patrface.gif" width=47 height=61 align=right hspace=10>
Back in the Highcastle area, you may want to go on East, towards Wolfram. By all means
do so. A house in Wolfram contains an Ambush of 3 Moredhel Warriors and 2 Rogues
<font color=#009900>[Combat 10]</font>. This Combat is actually an illusion created by
a Magician named Patrus, whom you will meet if you enter the house. Patrus will be one
of your Characters in Chapters 5 and 7. Vist the Temple of Tith, and don't miss the
Restorative Bushes North of the Temple. The Arms of Dala Shop has cheap Weapons for sale.
The Alchemist's Shop can only be entered after dark.<p>

<a name=dencamp>

<a href="dencamp.html">MAP OF DENCAMP AREA</a><p>

Farther East you will enter the Dencamp Sector. There are NO ENEMIES here until Chapter 3,
so feel free to roam, before you enter the Northwarden Sector.<p>

<a name=northwar>
<center>
<a href="northwar.html">MAP OF NORTHWARDEN AREA</a><p>
</center>

This area is Combat-free in this Chapter. If you've already been here in
Chapter 1 and solved Minstrel Tamney's mini-Quest, you can talk to him again now, twice.
<img src="praclute.gif" width=88 height=64 align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>
If you pay him 75 Gold Sovereigns, he will give you a Practice Lute [125] and raise your
Barding Skill substantially. You can actually meet him again, pay him 20 Gold Sovereigns,
and have your Barding Skill go up even more. Please consult the MAP WEB for details.<p>

You can exit Zone 5 South of Northwarden. This will land you near the Temple of Kahooli
in the Kenting Rush Sector of Zone 4. This is a good opportunity to Teleport back to Zone
3, in order to finish Chapter 2.<p>
