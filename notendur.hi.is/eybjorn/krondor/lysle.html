<font color=#ffcc00>LYSLE:</font>
We...We could be...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
...Twins, yes, so it seems. Seeing you, a great number of things suddenly seem crystal clear to me.<p>
What is your association with the Mockers in Krondor?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LYSLE:</font>
What do you mean? I don't...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Stop the idiot act, Lysle. I know you have something to do with the Mockers in Krondor. A few 
months ago, I was abducted by a band of cutthroats dressed as Nighthawks while I was 
investigating a rumor in the sewers. At the time I thought they had abducted me because I was 
close to Arutha, but that wasn't the case at all, was it?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LYSLE:</font>
That must mean things have gotten even worse than the Upright Man imagined. When he sent word 
for me in Kesh...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Excuse me...did you say Kesh, as in the Great Empire Of?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LYSLE:</font>
You of all people should know that the Upright Man has contacts everywhere, including under the 
Empress' nose. He couldn't very well operate the single most powerful guild in Midkemia without 
them. But as I w as saying - he sent for me in Kesh and asked for me to take a boat into Silden 
and check on a group of thieves who operated there. I can't really say more, but I confirmed the
Upright Man's suspicions. If you should get to Krondor before I do, tell one of the
thieves - a boy named Limm - that I think the Upright Man's right, though I am quite positive 
now that the Crawler is not Jocko Radburn. He should give you a reward for the information.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
If there is something in the offing that threatens the Prince...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LYSLE:</font>
Don't worry your head. The Nighthawks in Krondor were likely sent into Krondor to kill the 
Upright Man after I fumbled up matters investigating in Silden, not go after Arutha. This 
Crawler fellow that's running the new thieve's guild is determined to expand his empire, but 
he's been busy infiltrating other guilds. He's the shadow prince behind half a dozen, most 
notably the new Guild of the Romney. He's also training his men in magic...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
A whole band of thieves trained as magicians? I don't like the sound of it at all.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LYSLE:</font>
Neither do I, though for much different reasons. I'm still working on finding out who's training
them. Last trail I followed, I heard word that someone in Lyton wished to buy glory
hands - magic artifacts I had heard something about. I found this skeletal hand near Sethanon 
and I sold it to a fellow in Lyton named Glover. I figured if they were magicians, they'd spot 
the substitution and perhaps I would have a lead.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
But they bought it from you and killed your lead. How did you find the skeletal hand?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LYSLE:</font>
You'll probably find this a bit distasteful, but...I was going to dig up somebody from the 
Sethanon graveyard and just borrow a hand. Since that part of the world has been deserted for 
quite some time, I thought it would be my best bet to find what I needed without getting caught.<p>
Fortunately, some old ghoul saved me the trouble. I have no idea what this fellow was up to with
the corpse, but he was dragging it through this field like he was headed to the graveyard. At 
one point he apparently got tired or thirsty and left the body for a bit and I went over to 
liberate this dead man of his hand, but before I could finish, the old man came back. Since I 
nearly had the hand off, I came back the next day to see if it had wiggled loose in the 
transport...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
And so you found it and sold it to Glover in Lyton.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LYSLE:</font>
Just so, but my troubles didn't end there. There were a few men in Lyton who recognized me, 
apparently men working for the Crawler. Seems that he's issued a death token on my head after 
I was spotted in Silden. So, since then, I've been lying low.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Understandable... Someday, if we should meet again, I would like to talk to you some more. Find 
out more about where you came from.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LYSLE:</font>
You mean, find out if we're brothers? It's not likely. I was born in Tulan and only came to 
Krondor about three years ago when the Upright Man sent for me. I was never sure why he sent 
for me, but apparently he had heard of me. But, he is odd that way. I doubt I'll ever understand
the way his mind works.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
That makes two of us. Thank you for this talk at least, Lysle. You've been quite a help to us 
and it's been interesting seeing how others see me. I hope we can meet again.<p>

James motioned to the figure across the room.<p>

The man walked over to join them. He stood before them, eyebrows arched inquisitively.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LYSLE:</font>
Hello, Seigneur James. What brings you back here?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
We came back to check on where you sold the skeletal hand that you found near Sethanon. Did you 
say you sold it to some one named Glover in Lyton?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LYSLE:</font>
That I did.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I just wanted to check again before I went and made a fool of myself. Thanks again, Lysle.<p>
