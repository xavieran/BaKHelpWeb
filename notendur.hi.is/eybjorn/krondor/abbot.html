James motioned to the figure across the room.<p>

The man walked over to join them. He stood before them, eyebrows arched inquisitively.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GRAVES:</font>
Welcome gentlemen. What brings you to the Abbaye Ishap?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
My young charge here wished to visit your famed school of nobles. I don't think he would have 
let us leave Malac's Cross without paying a visit.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GRAVES:</font>
Well, well, well. I am pleased to see that our reputation precedes us. Am I to assume you are 
interested in becoming a new pupil, or are you visiting from our estimable rival, the Academy of
Magicians at Stardock?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
My father would never allow me to study magic formally. Even though he more than has the 
financial resources to send me to Stardock, he thinks it's a waste of a young noble's time to 
spend ten and twenty years with his nose stuck in a book and yet be hardly capable of doing 
anything else. If it weren't for a magician named Patrus that I met once, I wouldn't know 
anything of magic at all.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GRAVES:</font>
It is true that magicians study for longer periods of time with fewer visible results, but no 
course of study is a waste of time. And while magic is not a primary staple in our directed 
studies here, magician Pug is kind enough to occasionally send instructors from Stardock to 
lecture on issues that involve magicians. If you would be interested in enrolling...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I regret that we don't have time for that kind of detour. He is on crucial business that takes 
him elsewhere.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GRAVES:</font>
What about you, Seigneur? Is there anything in our curricula that interests you?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Books and scrolls? I'm a bit too old for that sort of thing now.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GRAVES:</font>
Really? How unfortunate for you. And I was preparing to offer you a chance to attend a lecture 
on tactics that is being taught by one of our guest instructors... Now that I think on it, you 
probably wouldn't be interested. It's being taught by this, well, odd fellow, a one eyed
gentleman who goes by the name Bas-Tyra.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Bas-Tyra? You mean Guy du Bas-Tyra? King Lyam's First Adviser?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GRAVES:</font>
Yes, I believe that's his title... It's part of the Abbaye Ishap's arrangement with King Lyam. 
In exchange for setting aside part of our facilities here for the purposes of education, the 
King occasionally will loan us some of the finest minds in the Kingdom. It works to our mutual 
benefit. I can still arrange to allow you in if you're still interested for a small donation of 
twenty sovereigns. What do you say, Seigneur?<p>

I'm afraid I can't admit you without it. It's one of the small constraints on us. As our abbaye 
is not in the habit of great enterprise, we pay for our guest's travel expenses with the funds 
we gather at the door. You'll probably miss tonight's lecture, but we may have a request for a 
repeat lecture, depending on our student turnout, so perhaps if you can come up with the funds 
you can still listen to him.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GRAVES:</font>
Gentlemen, welcome back to the Abbaye Ishap. How may I help you?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Several men were killed in Romney recently and my companions and I are investigating their 
murder. We were hoping you might be able to give us some information.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GRAVES:</font>
We are always at the disposal of the King's wishes. Please, ask your questions.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
There were two objects found on the bodies of the dead men. One was a rather ordinary looking 
brass spyglass and the other was a small spider statuette made of silver. Would you know
anything about either object?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GRAVES:</font>
Spyglasses are common devices, but silver spiders, now those would be quite rare. I've seen them
catalogued in books as magical poisoning devices but they would be prohibitively expensive for a
common murderer. Whomever used your spider would have to be a man with a great deal of money and
would have to have connections with Kesh. That's where they are made.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Thank you, you've been of tremendous help.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GRAVES:</font>
Glad to be of service. As I recall, you purchased tickets for the First Adviser's speech on 
enemy assessment, did you not? I trust it was educational.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Actually, we never got around to it. We ran short of time when we were last in Malac's Cross.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GRAVES:</font>
A pity. I understand that one of our bright stars - a Kyle Fischer, if I recall correctly - decided
to stand and debate the First Adviser's tactics on a battle for Deep Taunton. I don't believe 
I've ever seen that boy look quite so mortified for quite so many days. You're in luck, however,
because another of our guest instructors will be lecturing for a while and since you didn't use 
your ticket, it's still valid.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
What's the topic?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GRAVES:</font>
A subject that I think is already of interest to you. Tactics, once again, taught by Baron
Troville from Highcastle. I believe he will be discussing his battles against the moredhel.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Why isn't he massing his forces in the North?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GRAVES:</font>
He's awaiting a group of soldiers from Darkmoor. Until they arrive, he's been gracious enough 
to lend us his services. I should like to attend the lecture myself but my duties call me
elsewhere. Enjoy yourselves.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
We shall. Thank you.<p>

Owyn motioned to the figure across the room.<p>

The man walked over to join them. He stood before them, eyebrows arched inquisitively.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GRAVES:</font>
You have picked an inconvenient time for a visit. I...I have business to attend to.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Why would Pantathians be interested in attacking the Abbaye Ishap and why would they blame you 
for it? The citizens are terrified, fleeing the city for fear of their lives. They blame you,
abbot.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GRAVES:</font>
Please...I don't know why they would make these...accusations...I'm not responsible, I will not 
be responsible.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
If you're thinking of fleeing the city, I wouldn't advise it. We've been told that some of the 
townspeople intend to make you a present to the Pantathians as a prisoner.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GRAVES:</font>
The Pantathians don't take prisoners! They kill once they make their minds up on a target! It 
would be murder!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
It seems that the Pantathians are willing to do worse than that to Malac's Cross if you aren't 
turned over to them. Why don't you tell me why they're here? Perhaps we can help you if you help
us.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GRAVES:</font>
Greed. They're here because a certain spineless brother of the Abbaye Ishap looked up and said 
I am meant for greater things than this. He was unscrupulous, unflinching, dedicated to a 
singular selfish cause. With as little conscience as a man has when swatting a fly, he arranged 
that his abbot should be caught with a sum of money that was discovered missing from the 
brotherhood's coffers. Naturally, the brother then assumed the abbot's place.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
You. But you weren't able to keep the secret, were you? Someone discovered your deception.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GRAVES:</font>
My plan was seamless, as perfect as the most perfect pearl but somehow he found out. So we 
struck an arrangement. The Crawler agreed to silence so long as I contacted Pug and arranged 
for a magical tutor to be sent periodically to Malac's Cross. The tutors never knew that not all
of the men they trained were nobles and things went relatively well for four years...then Pug 
discovered the truth from one of the Crawler's men in Krondor. Pug withdrew his tutors, stripped
us of our books and left me incapable of fulfilling the details of my secret deal. So the
Crawler made a new demand. Since I could no longer train his rogues, I was to uncover a certain 
magical relic for him or forfeit my life. I refused, and his Pantathian masters were not pleased.
I responded with a few of the boys that Pug's adviser had taught magic, nobles, but apparently 
they were overmatched.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
The relic the Crawler wanted, was it a book by any chance?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GRAVES:</font>
I will say no more. The time is come that I made arrangements for my escape from Malac's Cross 
and you two may be my only hope. Find Mitchel Waylander and tell him what has happened. And tell
him I don't want anyone else hurt. Once he has made his arrangements, return here and tell me 
what I must do.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
What? We can't help a criminal escape justice!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GRAVES:</font>
The men and women of Malac's Cross aren't at all concerned about the criminality of my acts, boy.
They know nothing of them. All they know is that the Pantathians have asked for my skin and they
will do anything they can to protect themselves, even if it means turning over an innocent man. 
That is the justice they believe in. If you can still find me guilty after your deliberations, 
then don't bother coming back.<p>

An acolyte fetched the Abbot.<p>

In a few minutes he appeared, the look in his eyes wary, like those of a beaten dog. Shuffling 
forward, he spoke quietly to Owyn.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
He has a plan that he believes will work. He sent along the details.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GRAVES:</font>
Tactics, tactics, tactics, always tactics. A justified end to my life as an abbot, I suppose. 
The priest brought down by the pawn. The circle closes.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
It's not too late to do the right thing, abbot. You have a chance to strike back at the Crawler.
You can tell me how to get the relic so that he doesn't gain it. Tell me how to get the Book of 
Macros.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GRAVES:</font>
Book of Macros? I've never heard of it. I transcribed quite a few of the books that came from 
his library when he left Midkemia, but I believe I would have remembered reading a book by that 
title. I know very little about that magician except for what is written in Pug's or Tomas' 
historical commentaries on the Riftwar with the Tsurani. No, the Crawler was after a magical 
sword that was reputedly lost near Malac's Cross in the dim past. Personally, I don't believe 
the Guarda Revanche is anything but a myth.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
You just mentioned someone named Tomas. Who is that?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GRAVES:</font>
Hmph? Tomas? He's Warleader of the Elves in Elvandar and Consort to Queen Aglaranna. He was very
close to Pug as I understand it and I believe he also spent some little time with Macros.
Perhaps he may know about your Book of Macros.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
It's a lead. Thin, but a lead. Thank you, abbot. I think we have a book to find. Perhaps we will
meet again under happier circumstances...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GRAVES:</font>
Unlikely, unless you set your feet on the road to Kesh. I imagine that's where I go next.
Goodbye and farewell.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Kesh is it? Good luck.<p>
