Clearing his mind of distracting thoughts, Owyn waited for the spell to coalesce in 
his mind. At first there was darkness, but slowly a flame guttered into being 
behind his eyelids, grew brighter until he could clearly make out the details of 
an underground passage. Instinctively he knew he would have no need of a torch 
while exploring caverns as long as he cast the spell.

He felt his eyes twitch as a scene began unfolding before him. A battlefield. As 
he concentrated he somehow knew he was not looking out of his own eyes, but 
instead out of an enemy's eyes! Centered in his view was himself, staff held on 
high and body blazing light as he called down great power. A flash lashed down 
out of the skies and then... darkness and confusion. He...no, the enemy...was

many young magicians had formulated comic variations on the theme, Invitation 
was often referred less reverently to as A Kick In the Rump. Designed in the 
misty past by a mischievous spellcaster, it forced its unfortunate victims to 
suddenly stumble forward from an unseen kick.

The cavernous pit stretched across the narrow corridor. Standing close to the 
edge, Locklear quickly determined that it was far too wide to jump across, and 
far too deep to try climbing down.

A pit yawned before them.<p>
Careful not to edge too close and fall in, James shook his head. 
"The only way we're getting across that is to swing across it," he said. 
Glancing up at a small hook on the ceiling, he sighed, "If we only had a 
rope we could probably swing across this pit."

"The only way we're getting across that is to swing across it," he said. 
Glancing up at a small hook on the ceiling, he nodded. "Apparently, we're not 
the only ones to have faced this dilemma. I think I could attach a rope up 
there, shall we try to swing across?"

Covered with grime and grave mold, Owyn distaste fully flung back the heavy lid

Standing waist deep in the hole, Owyn levered open the lid of the pine box with

that was a mixture of relief and disappointment.<br>
"That's strange," Owyn said. "No body."

After a brief discussion with Gorath, Locklear shook his head. "I know the

comfortable with the idea of accidentally digging up dead people! Besides, we 
need a shovel. We'd ruin our swords digging."

Backing away from the defiled grave, Gorath watched in horror as the gas began
