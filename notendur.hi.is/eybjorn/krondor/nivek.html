Seigneur Locklear! Good to see you. Interesting news. Interesting news...<p>

Nivek, you old rascal. Got your ears to the grapevine again, eh? What is it this time?<p>

I've been to see Nia at the Six Toe near Sethanon. Ah... I can't really talk about it right now.
Why don't you come back later and see me?<p>

James grinned.<p>

Seated behind one of the benches was an old associate, Nivek, Lord Minister of Finances of the 
Western Realm. A loyal subject of Arutha, he had befriended both he and Seigneur Locklear during
their scramblings about in Krondor's streets and had taught the both of them a good deal about 
the workings of the Kingdom's finances.<p>

Looking down the considerable length of his nose, he greeted them cheerily.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
Seigneur James! What a pleasure to see you!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
The pleasure is mutual. How are the ledgers of the Kingdom, Nivek? Think we shall have enough 
money to keep the Kingdom running for the year?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
The ledgers are at a balance, but I daresay my thirst suffers a deficit of catastrophic
proportions. Though I handle thousands of sovereigns a day, I fear I haven't the command of 
more than a handful for my own use at the moment. I don't suppose you might be in a position...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
What do you say, Owyn? Do we buy a drink for the honorable tax collector or do we allow him to 
expire of thirst?<p>

Nivek squinted at them.<p>

Levering himself up from his table, he walked over to greet James.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
How nice it is to see you. What brings you into the Rainbow Parrot?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Ah, I see you're still in an upright position.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
Just because you are counted among Arutha's favorites, James, do not be impertinent. I only
on occasion drink a bit too much, but I have not indulged in that pleasure in quite some time. 
Would you perhaps be disposed to purchase me a drink?<p>

FIRST DRINK<p></font>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
Rumors? My goodness me, I'm not the kind to consort with the rumormongers. No sire, you should 
know that. Of course, I do occasionally hear a few facts that are of interest to people.
Accounting is a...UHRUP...fascinating business you know, all the figures and such.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Something a little more lively if you please. Stolen cows, cheating wives, dishonest
traders - that sort of thing.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
The prurient and the scatological, eh? Hmmm. Well, let me think on it. I believe I heard
something last week - at least I believe it was last week. Maybe it was the week before that. 
Couldn't have been before that annexation in Malac's Cross ---<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
If you please, Nivek. We would like to get out of here before tomorrow.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
...I...AHHHP...would be most pleased to accommodate you, but it seems that my mouth has grown a 
bit dry. What do you say to buying me another drink?<p>

<font color=#cc6600 size=+1>
SECOND DRINK<p></font>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
Ahh now. That's much better. What was I saying? Oh yes, about this story. Th-ere
was...UHRUP...this fellow that lives near Sethanon that has filed three new claims on land in 
the past year. Thr-ee, ya understand that?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Is there something suspect about his purchases?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
Oh, his selections of land are nice enough. Prime pieces of land matter of fact, but he's
without a...AAHHHP...ti-tle! How'z a person of ignoble birth manage to buy three prime estates? 
Tell me that!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
What was this fellow's name? Perhaps we should look into it.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
What kind of ques---RUCHH---question is that now? Ya think I carry my ledger about in my head? 
I mean you might as well ass me the name of Prince Arufa's---Arutha's wife...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
You mean to tell me that you can't remember Princess Anita's name?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
No---what is her name?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
You were telling me about the man near Sethanon. What else do you know about him? Tell me about 
the man.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
...Ahhhh...I fink his name was Fibber... NAH, that's not right, not right at all... Fleeber...Monk's
Finger...Map's Flipper...Fever... FEEBER! Maxie Feeber! Thatsss it! Ya know, I'm really, really 
getting tired now and maybe I should go home.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
There's still a few things I need to know. Think you can hold out for a just a few more minutes?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
Sure...RUCCHH...I kin do it. Need something else ta drink though. You buy---UHRUP--ing?<p>

<font color=#cc6600 size=+1>
THIRD DRINK<p></font>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
That hit the---the ahhh---What?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I suppose you mean that your drink hit the mark. Why don't you tell us a little more about this 
Max Feeber character?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
NAHnahnahnahh...that's bori---UHRUP--ng... let's talk about the last year. Did ya know that for 
every cow in Midkemia, we get a golden sovereigns a year alone just for their manure... Did ya 
know that? BETCHA didn't! An for every duck...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Max Feeber. I want to know about Max Feeber.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
Dokay. Moxie Flipper. Ahm, I know that gee was tryging to buy up some of the propurtee left in 
Sethanon a few years back from Jared Lycrow but Jared wouldn't sell to no one, so Moxie 
co--AHRUP---cooked up this idea... Sure you don't want to hear about the ducks?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
No. Just tell us about Max. What did he do?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
Ee gots him selk a shovel and dug---ARRGHA---to try to skeer Jared. Corse Jared wasn't skeered 
of nuthin but it shore fri-teened---UHRUP---Nia...<p>

What was he digging up?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
...Goin ta slep now... Gnite...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Maybe I could buy you another drink?<p>

The tax collector looked ill.<p>

Slumped on his bench, he gazed into open space, his monocle fogged and his features slackened. 
Seeing Owyn, he seemed to pale somewhat.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
Please state your business quickly and quietly. I'm...incapacitated...just now.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
I' m sorry to interrupt your hangover, sir, but it's very important that we speak to you. Have 
you seen or spoken to Pug of Stardock in the past few days? He's disappeared from the palace and
we' re trying to find out where he might have gone or done before he left.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
It could be that he and I dressed in the Princess Anita's finest gowns and danced with skeletons
on the docks, but I don't remember a single detail of this last evening. I had a bit too much 
drink, I believe...and I'm regretting it with great acuity at this moment.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Surely you might remember the events when you entered the bar?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
Nothing. Not a moment...mind's as blank as a slate...I don't even remember where it is I mislaid
my keys.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Maybe if you found your keys, you'll recall last night's events.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
That is a respectable theory, young friend, but as I am in no condition to move I cannot test
your hypothesis...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Tell me what they look like. If we run across them, we will bring them back to you and maybe
then you'll remember.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
Not much to distinguish it from other keys...It has my name etched up on it...that is all...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
So, have you found the key that will unlock my past?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
If you mean, have we found your key, the answer is yes. I have it here in my pack, but...it 
might be advisable for you to consult a solicitor for advice.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
A solicitor? Why? Where were my keys?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
We found them on a dead man. He was just outside of Krondor. It looked as though the side of 
his head had been bashed in with a large, blunt weapon. Was he an enemy of yours?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
If you're suggesting that in my stupor I killed someone, you've lost your senses. I'm not 
violent when I'm drunk, and in fact I tend to fall unconscious after even a few tankards of 
ale... I am starting to recall a few things about my...episode...shall we call it? I remember 
a man who came into the Rainbow Parrot and offered me a drink and then it seems I followed him 
somewhere...outside of town, perhaps?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Where you killed him.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
No, where he...he offered me more to drink...and then he took me someplace else, or did his 
friend take me there? And then...after that, everything's still a blank...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
So these strangers got you drunk and stole your key. Does your house key open any other locks 
other than your house?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
Yes, it opens the locks to my correspondent's office in Eggley. The Prince had my keys made 
especially so I could have access to any of the Kingdom treasury offices.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Mind if we borrow this key for a while? I want to test a theory.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIVEK:</font>
Be my guest. Anything to help my own cause. I'd really like to get this cleared up.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
We'll do what we can. Thanks.<p>
