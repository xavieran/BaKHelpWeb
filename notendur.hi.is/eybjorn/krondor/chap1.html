Please note: From a quick glance at the MAP it should be obvious that the most direct path towards
Krondor is the one leading South from the starting point (between Yabon and LaMut). It is quite
possible to finish the game by choosing this route. However, you should bear in mind that you have access
to many other areas in this Chapter. Your characters are poorly equipped at the beginning of the game,
and you can use this freedom in order to boost their abilities and collect resources. Furthermore, there
are various secondary Quests you can perform in this chapter. So think twice before
you barge on towards Krondor !</b></font>

Consider the following:<p>
<ul><li><font color=#00ff00>The most direct route, of course, will lead through Lamut, Zun, and Questor's View, to Krondor.<p>
    <li><font color=#ffff00>Even if you choose to do this, it is highly recommmended that you first explore the area to the
        North, i.e. the road between Yabon and Tyr-Sog. At the crossroads south of Tyr-Sog you can go 
        East (see below), South (towards Loriel), or just return West (where you came from).<p>
    <li><font color=#00ff00>South of LaMut you can enter the Mac Mordain Cadal.<p>
    <li><font color=#ffff00>South of Zun you can choose to go East, towards Hawk's Hollow. After Hawk's Hollow you can go
        North (towards Loriel), East (into Dimwood), or South (towards Eggley).<p>
    <li><font color=#00ff00>If you're really adventurous, you can take the longest route possible. At the Tyr-Sog crossroads
        go East towards Highcastle & Northwarden. Then choose the road leading through Kenting Rush, Romney,
        Malac's Cross, and then to Krondor. This route is not exactly recommended - but if
        you're a real die-hard,
        this is probably the route of your choice. (Save regularly!)<p>

</font><p></center>

<blockquote>
Search Haseth's body, then go Southwest and empty the Chest. Now go East to the Main Road.
An inter-party dialogue will be triggered, so pay attention. Go East towards the Main Road.
Now go North.<p>
<center><a href="yabon.html">MAP OF YABON AREA</a></center><p>
Investigate Yabon. The Crossroads Shop deals mainly in Weapons and Armor. Here you will be able to sell whatever
you pick up.<img src="whetstn.gif" width=87 height=64 align=right><img src="hammer.gif" width=87 height=64 align=left> You will not be able to afford any of the higher-priced items at first, but the Whetstone and 
Armorer's Hammer will tempt you. Remember: You'll get a better price for Weapons and Armor if you repair
before you sell.<br clear=all>
<img src="mw.gif" width=92 height=94 align=left hspace=10 vspace=5>
Go on North. A path towards North off the Main Road will bring you to the SPIDER Chest. Go back to the Main Road,
and head East. Soon you will run into your first Enemies, two Moredhel Warriors <font color=#009900>[Combat 14]</font>. Kill them, and don't forget to
search their bodies. No go on East. Where a path branches off the Main Road towards South, you will have to
fight a lone Moredhel Warrior <font color=#009900>[Combat 13]</font>. Now take the Southern Path, and enter the House.<img src="book.gif" width=88 height=63 align=right> Talk to Brother Jeremy, and accept your
first Quest: Find a Chest just West of Hawk's Hollow on the southern side of a small hill. Find out what is in the
Chest, and Jeremy will give you a copy of Thiful's Bird Migrations, a book that will increase your characters' skills.
(You're not supposed to solve the Quest NOW, but keep it in mind.)<p>
Directly North of the single Moredhel Warrior you will find a Mound of Dirt. Then go back to the Main Road and keep on
heading East. Check out the Dead Body by the roadside.<p>
<a name=shad>

<center><a href="tyrsog.html">MAP OF TYR-SOG AREA</a></center><p>

<img src="ms.gif" width=92 height=94 align=left hspace=10>
You will now stumble into your first TRAP. If you think this one is difficult, just wait!
This one is too easy to be true: First make Owyn use the INVITATION Spell<br>(at Cost = 1) on the
Moredhel Spellcaster <font color=#009900>[Combat 16]</font> - he will barge
into the Trap Pole Current and die. Then make Gorath navigate through the Trap. (Remember: Push the HEART Button if you want a character to REST.)
<br clear=all><p>

<a name=cand>
<img src="scroll.gif" width=88 height=64 align=left><img src="note.gif" width=88 height=64 align=right>
In a valley to the South find the SHADOW Chest, containing the EYES OF ISHAP Scroll for Owyn
and a <a href="shadnote.html">SPYNOTE.</a><p>

Back on the Main Road, go on East. The House at the end of the path leading North is empty, but a Southern valley contains
the CANDLE Chest (don't miss it!) - containing a Blessed Moredhel Lamprey, a <a href="candnote.html">SPYNOTE</a>, and TWO Scrolls for Owyn
(STARDUSK and FLAMECAST).<p>

Now go East until you reach the bridge. Cross it. North of the bridge you'll find a Graveyard,
and a Chest. You can check the Chest, but the Graveyard will have to wait until you've found a
Shovel.<img src="shovel.gif" width=88 height=64 align=right> Go East towards the crossroads.
The East road leads to the Temple of Dala and Highcastle. At this stage you are hardly ready for
this arduous journey! The South road leads to Loriel and the Temple of Ishap. If you choose to 
go there, you will have to fight three Moredhel Warriors <font color=#009900>[Combat 12]</font>
before you cross the bridge, and two Moredhel Warriors <font color=#009900>[Combat 11]</font>
after you've crossed it.<img src="praclute.gif" width=88 height=64 align=left>
Your best choice for the time being is to head North, into the town of Tyr-Sog.
In THE THREE HILLMEN Shop you won't be able to sell any Weapons or Armor, but if you're holding
any Shells, Moredhel Brooches, etc., sell them now. Buy a Shovel and a Practice Lute, and of course 
a Whetstone and an Armorer's Hammer if you need them. Extra Picklocks might be helpful as well.<p>

<center><a href="tyrsog.html">MAP OF TYR-SOG AREA</a></center><p>

If you can afford the Practice Lute give it to Owyn (best Barding Skill). Now USE the Lute until it 
disappears. This will improve Owyn's Barding Skill, especially if you make sure that ONLY his Barding
Skill is SELECTED, before he starts practising!<p>

<img src="weedwalk.gif" width=88 height=64 align=left>
Before leaving Tyr-Sog, try going North and meet Finn, who will tell you to return.
Now head back West. Revisit the Graveyard near the bridge. Now that you have a Shovel, you will
find WEEDWALKERS in one of the Graves. Don´t touch the southernmost stone (Baby Irisa) - unless you want to
fight a Shade <font color=#009900>[Combat 19]</font>. Finally retrace your steps West towards Yabon, where
you started. You can sell surplus Weapons and Armor in the Yabon Shop. Remember to repair before you sell,
and always make sure your characters are carrying the best!

<tr><td><b>

<font color=#00ffff>
If you're eager for adventure, you can attempt the East road from Tyr-Sog, before returning to
Yabon. If you want to do this in Chapter 1, I would suggest you do it later, when your characters have
found better equipment and raised their Skills a bit.<p>

<center><a href="dala.html">MAP OF DALA AREA</a></center><p>

The Temple is not far, but you
will have to fight a group of SIX Moredhel Warriors <font color=#009999>[Combat 9]</font>, and another group of
FIVE Moredhel Warriors <font color=#009999>[Combat 8]</font> before you reach it. If you then insist on
going on to the East even farther, you will run into another group of FIVE Moredhel Warriors <font color=#009999>[Combat 7]</font>.
It is quite useful to reach the Temple of Dala in this Chapter, in order to be able to TELEPORT there later on in the game.
Also, in a valley South-East of the Temple, there are three Moredhel Chests containing valuable Items, among them a Keshian
Tapir.<p>

If you decide to take this path now (or more advisedly later in this Chapter), and then brazenly go on still farther East,
please use the <a href="allzones.html">MAP WEB</a> for detailed guidance. You can also consult a
<a href="longway1.html">SPECIAL PAGE</a>, which contains a concise guide.<p>

<img src="phillip.gif" width=120 height=108 align=right hspace=10>
South of Yabon, keep to the Main Road, until you spot the DIE Chest on your right. Slightly
farther South you will meet Squire Phillip, and be able to converse with him. He will give you
some basic tips. (If you've been to the Temple of Dala, and accepted the Grain Quest, you can
also ask him about GRAIN. He will tell you where to find the Bag of Grain. Make a note of it,
since you will have to wait until Chapter 2 or 3 in order to solve this Quest.)
Don't miss an ordinary Chest, and a Mound of Dirt in the near neighborhood. Soon you will reach a Western path leading to LaMut. Before you
go all the way into LaMut, look South, and find the LaMut Graveyard. Check out all the graves - a <a href="lamunote.html">SPYNOTE</a> is buried in one of them.<p>

Enter LaMut. Don't miss the small treasure on the bridge. Go to the Garrison, then to the Blue Wheel Inn. Meet Sumani. He can teach you a trick or two, if you 
can afford it (it's worth it). Here you will initatiate a new Quest: Recover a Ruby stolen from Makala's entourage. Search out Kiefer Alescook in Loriel - he might hold the Ruby.<p>

While in the tavern, also speak to DUBAL AN LOCH, a Dwarf who will hint at one more
Quest - kill the BRAK NURR in the Mac Mordain Cadal.<p>

<center><a href="xlamut.html">MAP OF LAMUT AREA</a></center><p>

Now go on South. Fight a Moredhel Warrior <font color=#009900>[Combat 01]</font>. A Western Path will soon lead towards the Mac Mordain Cadal.
Don't miss a Locked Chest near the fork. Enter the Mines. Talk to
Naddur Ban Dok. Here your aim is to kill the Brak Nurr.<p>

<center><a href="macupr.html">MAP OF MAC MORDAIN CADAL (Upper)</a></center><p>

<img src="bn.gif" width=92 height=94 align=left hspace=10 vspace=5>
If you know the path, you can actually reach the Brak Nurr without encountering any other
enemies! The Brak Nurr <font color=#009900>[Combat 05]</font> is quite easy to kill - he can't move and is easily immobilized with
Owyn's DESPAIR THY EYES. Naddur will reward you handsomely, after you've killed the beast. You can not go on to
the Lower Level of the Mac Mordain Cadal in this Chapter.<p>

<img src="rg.gif" width=92 height=94 align=left hspace=10 vspace=5>
<img src="rm.gif" width=92 height=94 align=right hspace=10 vspace=5>
Explore the Upper Mac thoroughly. There are various Chests to be found.
All the Enemies are Rogues.
There is one Combat with TWO Rogues <font color=#009900>[Combat 02]</font>,
one with THREE Rogues <font color=#009900>[Combat 01]</font>,
one with 4 Rogues <font color=#009900>[Combat 04]</font>,
and one with 3 Rogues and a Rogue Mage (kill him first!) <font color=#009900>[Combat 03]</font>.<p>

<img src="cleroilc.gif" width=88 height=64>
<img src="dragston.gif" width=88 height=64>
<img src="rope.gif" width=87 height=64>
</center>
You can pick up a lot of useful things here. One of the Rogues has Elven Armor, and many have Crossbows and Quarrels.
Clerical Oilcloth can be picked up from one dead Enemy, and a Guilder's Passkey as well. Dragonstone is particularly
valuable. The DRUM Chest has Weedwalkers. The SIEVE Chest contains Lorgan's Journal. The BARROW Chest holds a Ring of Prandur,
as well as some Rope and Dalatail Milk.<p>

<a name=zun>
<center><a href="zun.html">MAP OF ZUN AREA</a></center><p>

After you exit the Mac Mordain Cadal, return to LaMut in order to sell all the spoils.
Then go back South, towards Zun. There's a Mound of Dirt to be found, and
TWO Moredhel Warriors <font color=#009900>[Combat 02]</font> to be fought along the road.
In ZUN you can buy Rations at The Green Cat, and Restoratives in Kege's Herbs. Also, there's
an easily overlooked valley South-East of Zun, where you can fight TWO Moredhel
Warriors <font color=#009900>[Combat 03]</font>, and find a Chest and a Mound of Dirt.<p>
<center><p>

<a name="hawk">
<font size=+3 color=#00ffff>HAWK'S HOLLOW - LORIEL</font><p>
</center>
South of Zun you go directly South towards Krondor after you've dealt with a silly Trap.
However, you're better off taking the Eastern Road towards Hawk's Hollow,<img src="ruby.gif" width=87 height=65 align=left>
in order to complete two Quests. Recover Makala's Ruby, and find Brother Jeremy's Chest (see above).<br clear=all>

<a name=killian>
<center><a href="killian.html">MAP OF KILLIAN AREA</a></center><p>

<img src="glkill.gif" width=47 height=47 align=right>
Soon after taking the Eastern Road towards Hawk's Hollow you will run into 
THREE Moredhel Warriors <font color=#009900>[Combat 04]</font>. Visit the
Temple of Killian. Look out for the FOG Chest nearby. At JOSEPH THE ANIMAL'S (sic),
an Armorer's Shop, you can cheaply get all your Armor into tip-top shape. There's
not much of interest in this area, so head for Hawk's Hollow.<p>

<a name=hollow>
<center><a href="hhollow.html">MAP OF HAWK'S HOLLOW AREA</a></center><p>

<a name=luca>
Soon you will have to deal with two more Moredhel Warriors <font color=#009900>[Combat 05]</font>.
Now keep your eyes peeled, and go South off the Road. Three Rogues <font color=#009900>[Combat 18]</font>
await you there, one of them carrying a <a href="lucanote.html">Spynote.</a><img src="note.gif" width=88 height=64 align=left>
They are guarding the Chest you're looking for, but BEWARE - the chest is TRAPPED, and will explode unless you've cast SCENT OF SCARIG
and your Lockpicking Skill is more than 55! The Damage is only 25, so you'll probably survive.
Don't hesitate to appropriate whatever is in the Chest - Brother Jeremy won't mind. A good night's sleep should be enough to
restore your Health/Stamina points.<p>
<a name=loriel>
<img src="isaac.gif" width=106 height=95 align=right>
Check out Hawk's Hollow. Lucan can teach you a Trick. The KEY Chest is situated not far to the 
North-East - it contains a <a href="keynote.html">Spynote.</a>
Next locate Isaac to the North. (Isaac is important to many sub-plots, so pay attention to whatever
he says). You will find a Chest and a Dirt nearby. Farther East there are two more Combats (and Caches):
THREE Moredhel Warriors on the road <font color=#009900>[Combat 06]</font>, with the Charnel House nearby,
and an Ambush House with THREE Moredhel Warriors <font color=#009900>[Combat 07]</font>, with a Locked
Chest nearby.<p>
This area can be exited to the East in two places. Both will lead to either the DIMWOOD or the
TEMPLE OF SILBAN. You may certainly want to go to both places in this Chapter, but let's not do
this now.<p>

<a name=xloriel>
Exit the HAWK'S HOLLOW area via the Northern Exit, towards Loriel. You will almost certainly run into a lone
Moredhel Warrior <font color=#009900>[Combat 17]</font> first.<p>

<center><a href="xloriel.html">MAP OF AREA SOUTH OF LORIEL</a></center><p>

Go on North towards Loriel. You're bound to run into some Moredhel Warriors on the way <font color=#009900>[Combats 08, 09, 10]</font>,
and one Trap including a Moredhel Spellcaster, which you'll easily deal with, if you just make sure he
can't cast any Spells <font color=#009900>[Combat 15]</font>.<img src="herbalp.gif" width=87 height=64 align=right>
Stay away from Orno's House, unless you want to catch the Plague (21%). It's nothing to worry 
about - if you have Herbal Packs, a night's sleep is all you need to get cured.
If you don't, visit Michele the Healer in Loriel - she will cure you
for 25 Gold Sovereigns, which is much less than any Temple would charge.<p>

<center><a href="tyrsog.html">MAP OF TYR-SOG / LORIEL AREA</a></center><p>

Don't miss the STRANGER Chest South of Loriel. Once in Loriel, locate Keifer Alescook,
and find out that Isaac (the rogue!) actually holds the GEM you're looking for!<p>
In the valley North of Loriel you will find the TEMPLE OF ISHAP.<p>

Now go back South and relocate Isaac. He will admit to holding Makala's Ruby, but refuse to 
part with it, unless you can repair his Sword. You can do this if your Weaponcraft Skill is
more than 45%. Once Isaac's Sword is repaired, he will hand over a Ruby of extremely poor 
quality.<p> 

Go back North towards the bridge North of Loriel. Go North and West in order to finish Brother 
Jeremy's Quest. If you haven't already killed them, you will meet TWO Moredhel
Warriors <font color=#009900>[Combat 11]</font>
South of the bridge, and THREE Moredhel Warriors <font color=#009900>[Combat 12]</font> North 
of the bridge.<p>

<font color=#cccc00>
TIP: You don't need to cross the bridge: You can go North-West by the river's Southern edge.<p>
</font>


<img src="book.gif" width=88 height=64 align=left>
<img src="ruby.gif" width=87 height=65 align=right>
If you re-visit Brother Jeremy's House, he will give you THIFUL'S BIRD MIGRATIONS.
Then speed on towards the LaMut Garrison, hand over Makala's Ruby, and earn a reward of 100
Gold Sovereigns.<p>

<center><a href="allzones.html">[MAP WEB]</a><p></center>

<font color=#00cccc>
At this point you will have thoroughly explored ZONE 1. There are four exits from this
Zone. As mentioned above, the road East of Tyr-Sog will lead you into ZONE 5, towards the
Temple of Dala, and ultimately to Highcastle and Northwarden. The exit South of Zun leads
into ZONE 2, towards Questor's View, the Temple of Sung, and Krondor. East of Hawk's Hollow
there are two exits. The Southern one leads to the Temple of Silban, the towns of Eggley and
Tanneurs, and ultimately to Krondor. The Northern one leads to ZONE 7, which is the Dimwood.
</font><p>
 
<a name="dimw">
<center>
<font size=+3 color=#00ffff>DIMWOOD</font><p></center>

You can enter Dimwood now, if you dare. <a href="c1dimtrp.html">A nasty Trap</a> awaits you at the Western entrance.
Although Dimwood is an area which you will explore thoroughly in Chapter 7, it is open to you in Chapters 1, 2, 3 and 6.
If you enter in any of the early Chapters, you can perform Witch Wilindi's Quest.<p>

<img src="well.gif" width=82 height=92 align=left hspace=10>
WITCH WILINDI'S QUEST can be solved in Chapter 1. After the Trap, go East, and look out for Ockie's House to the North.
Speak to Ockie, who will tell you about the Witch. You will now have to fight
TWO Scorpions <font color=#009900>[Combat 16]</font>. Next locate Wilindi's house to the South-East.
You will have to fight SIX Scorpions <font color=#009900>[Combat 17]</font>, before you can
approach the house, so make sure you save before the fight!<p>

If you now try to enter the house, Wilindi will speak.
Drink from the Well nearby.
One of your characters will get Poisoned (18%), but you can easily cure him with Restoratives [4] or the
application of Herbal Pack and Sleep.<br>
You need Silverthorn
Anti-Venom in order to depoison the Well. If you don't have it, you can find some in the GRAVE
Chest in the South-Westernmost corner of Dimwood. Purify the well, and speak to the
Witch. She will reward you with Lewton's Concentrate [28], which will make Owyn happy.<p>
<a name=1dim>
<font color=#00cccc>
You can explore all of Dimwood in Chapter 1, if you want. Some of the Combats might be too
much to handle at this stage of the game, but a lot of them can be avoided. Dimwood contains
extremely valuable treasures for you to find, particularly a lot of SCROLLS for Owyn, some of them
quite scarce. If you intend to spend some time here in this Chapter, it might be a good idea to
use the <a href="allzones.html">MAP WEB</a>, in order to plan ahead, and figure out which
Combats can be avoided.<br>You can also consult a <a href="longway1.html#1dim">SPECIAL PAGE</a>, which
contains a quick guide to the Combats in this Zone.<p>
</font>

<font color=#cccc00>
In Chapter 1 Owyn can find the following SCROLLS in Dimwood:</font><p>

GRIEF OF 1000 NIGHTS <font color=#cccc00>(NW Sector, FARRIER Chest)</font><br>
NIGHTFINGERS <font color=#cccc00>(SW Sector, Trapped Chest) <font color=#009999>[Skill > 90 / Damage: 65]</font></font><br>
NIGHTFINGERS <font color=#cccc00>(N Sector, STOVE Chest)</font><br>
WINDS OF EORTIS <font color=#cccc00>(E Sector, Ordinary Chest)</font><br>
UNFORTUNATE FLUX <font color=#cccc00>(SE Sector, Trapped Chest)</font> <font color=#009999>[Skill > 62 / Damage: 200]</font><br>
GAMBIT OF THE EIGHT <font color=#cccc00>(SE Sector, TROLLS Chest)</font><br>
MIRRORWALL <font color=#cccc00>(NE Sector, MATTRESS Chest)</font><br>
THE UNSEEN <font color=#cccc00>(NE Sector, PATH Chest)</font><br>
BLACK NIMBUS <font color=#cccc00>(N Sector, THISTLE Chest)</font><br>

<font color=#00cccc>
If you exit ZONE 1 via the Southern exit East of Hawk's Hollow, you will reach the Temple of
Silban, and the towns of Eggley and Tanneurs.</font><p>

<center><a href="nsilban.html">MAP OF SILBAN AREA</a></center><p>
<img src="glsilb.gif" width=47 height=47 align=left hspace=10>
Head towards the Temple of Silban. If you exited the Hawk's Hollow area via the Northern Exit (see above),
or if you have been to Dimwood in the meantime, the Temple will be on the Main Road to the South.
If you exited the Hawk's Hollow area via the Southern Exit, you will have to fight TWO 
Moredhel Warriors <font color=#009900>[Combat 04]</font> and go South-East in order to reach the
Temple. A <a href="stainote.html">Spynote</a> will be found in the STAIRS Chest nearby.<p>

<img src="qp.gif" width=92 height=94 align=left hspace=10>
Before you enter the Temple of Silban you will have to fight
THREE Quegian Pirates <font color=#009900>[Combat 20]</font>.
Once inside, talk to the Priestess, who will ask you
to take a message to the Franklin. Now go South
towards the Crossroads.<p>
<font color=#3366cc>A CAVE found in this area can NEVER be entered!</font>
<br clear=all><p>

<center><a href="ssilban.html">MAP OF AREA SOUTH OF SILBAN</a></center><p>

At the Crossroads you will run into THREE Quegian Pirates
<font color=#009900>[Combat 05]</font>.

<img src="tsligbow.gif" width=88 height=65 align=left>
<a name=tann>

If you go WEST now, you will end up near Questor's View (see ZUN - KRONDOR). 
This is not where you want to go for the time being, but look out, though, for a 
Trapped Chest SW of the Crossroads, containing a
<a href="xdelnote.html">Spynote</a> and a Tsurani Light Crossbow.<p>
<a name=eggmap>
If you go East at the above mentioned crossroads, you will soon find the Franklin's House. 
Give him the message he's been waiting for.
Now head South and fight three Moredhel Warriors and a Spellcaster
<font color=#009900>[Combat 06]</font>. Beware of the Spellcaster - if allowed to cast, he will 
probably freeze Gorath.<p>

<center><a href="eggley.html">MAP OF EGGLEY AREA</a></center><p>

Soon you'll reach Eggley.<img src="devon.gif" width=110 height=96 align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>
Most of the houses are empty, and one house (which looks like a shop) can't be opened until 
Chapter 6. Check out the Graveyard. Leave the grave of Melba Kane alone, unless you want to
fight a Shade <font color=#009900>[Comabt 47]</font>. Talk to Devon in the Tavern, and learn
about the Collector. (If you've talked to Isaac about Devon, you can play Pokiir with him. If
you decline, a new topic, SELF-DEFENSE, will appear. Devon can raise your Defense Skill - for
a fee.)<p>

Now go back to the Temple of Silban, and talk
to the Priestess. She will ask you to find the Collector. Return to Eggley, and head South 
towards Tanneurs. West of the main road, just South of Eggley, you can find a suit of Elven
Armor [11%] if your Scouting Skill is 41% or more. On the way you can stop at Kellyn's House and learn 
some history. The Eastern branch off the Main Road leads towards Sethanon and the Southern
entrance to Dimwood.<p>

<a name=tanneurs>

<center><a href="tanneurs.html">MAP OF TANNEURS AREA</a></center><p>

Just before you reach Tanneurs, you will stumble into a Trap. It looks difficult, but isn't.
Make Locklear do all the work: First shove the Transparent Crystal in front of the left Blaster, then shove the Solid Crystal in front of the
right Blaster. Now Locklear can exit.<p>
<img src="hornalgo.gif" width=88 height=64 align=left><img src="praclute.gif" width=88 height=64 align=right> 
In Tanneurs a Locked House will yield a HORN OF ALGON KOKOON. Check out Hamil's Pawn Shop as well: the Practice Lute will enable you to raise 
Owyn's Barding Skills considerably. (Before Owyn practices, make sure that ONLY his Barding Skill is
selected.)<p>
In Tom's Tavern "Snake Eyes" Spitzer, a gambler, will refuse to gamble with you, as he owes some money to
a man in the back room. This man is actually the Collector! Click the INN hotspot, and you will 
meet him. He will automatically go to Silban's Temple. If YOU go back there, the Priestess will
reward you handsomely: each character will receive Restoratives [24] and Herbal Packs [8].<p>

Before you leave Tom's Tavern, talk to Spitzer again. Now that the Collector has left, Spitzer will finally want to gamble. If you lose, he will want to go on
gambling. If you win he will stop, but if you talk to him again, he will be ready once more.<p>

NOTE: If you haven't accepted the Silban Quest, Spitzer will gamble freely.<p>

<font size=+2 color=#cccc00>LET'S MAKE LOTS OF MONEY!</font>
<br clear=all></center>

<font color=#cccc00>
James David Allan (in Manitoba) has pointed out the following procedure, which basically allows you to earn as much money as you wish! I wonder if this is a bug,
or a deviously concealed loophole. If you haven't already Barded in Tom's Tavern, do so now! You will earn 130s, if your Skill is 100% (which it should be by now).
<ul><li>Now talk with Spitzer, and gamble (the maximum 50).
<ul><li>If you win, he will stop. Talk to him again, and gamble. Do this until you lose.
    <li>If you lose, stop gambling. Now you can Bard again, earning 250s!
</ul></ul>
You can repeat the above procedure endlessly, earning amazing amounts of money. It's not exactly fun, but worth it.
(I tried as far as 8000s, before getting bored.) Note that you can return here (by walking and teleporting) in Chapters 2, 3 and 6, in order to earn even more
money! You will then run into new enemies, but THAT shouldn't keep you away from the dough!<p></font>

The area South of Tanneurs isn't very interesting, but by all means explore it (before you return
to Silban Temple to collect your reward). Various Spynotes you've found suggest heavy Moredhel 
attacks south of Tanneurs, but this is not true! There are only two Combats here in Chapter 1 - one
with two Quegian Pirates and one Rogue <font color=#009900>[Combat 07]</font>, the other with
three Quegian Pirates <font color=#009900>[Combat 08]</font>.
There are also two Moredhel Chests in the area.<p>

<center><a href="allzones.html">[MAP WEB]</a></center><p>

<font color=#00cccc>
If you go on traveling the road South of Tanneurs, you will reach Krondor soon. But there's still
a substantial area of ZONE 2, which you still haven't explored, the road between Zun and Krondor.
There are various treasures to be pick up here, two Temples to be visited, and an important sub-quest
to be performed. You must find and kill NAGO, a powerful Moredhel Spellcaster. You should already have
picked up some clues to this quest, e.g. from Isaac and Devon. Since you need to pick up a reward at
the Temple of Silban (if you've found the Collector), go back North. Stop at the Eggley Tavern on the
way. All the inhabitants are back, making merry - and this is now a "real" tavern, where you can eat,
sleep and bard. From the Temple of Silban, retrace your path to Hawks Hollow, towards Zun.<p>

<font size=+3 color=#00ffff>Road from ZUN to KRONDOR</font><p>
</center>

<center><a href="nqw.html">MAP OF AREA NORTH OF QUESTOR'S VIEW</a></center><p>

The area South of Zun, North of Questor's View, is pretty dull (at least in Chapter 1). You can
fight two Moredhel Warriors <font color=#009900>[Combat 01]</font>, and locate one Moredhel Chest.<p>

<center><a href="qw.html">MAP OF QUESTOR'S VIEW AREA</a></center><p>

The Questor's View area is slightly more interesting. You will run into three Moredhel Warriors
<font color=#009900>[Combat 02]</font>, and directly North of the Combat site, you can find three
Moredhel Chests (and a Trap which is not really a Trap). A Shop, Rygate & Supply, will be found
nearby. In the town of Questor's View, visit Tad Questor. He can teach you a trick or two, if you
have 75 Gold Sovereigns to spare. In the Questor's View Graveyard, Timothy Weyant's grave contains
a Shade. At the main road fork East of Questor's you will need to fight two Moredhel Warriors and
a Quegian Pirate <font color=#009900>[Combat 03]</font>. The North Road leads towards the Temple of
Silban and Eggley (where you may have been already). A path off this road will bring you to Morgan
Hurley's Shop. Go South, towards Sarth.<p>

<center><a href="xsarth.html">MAP OF SARTH AREA</a></center><p>

<img src="rowe.gif" width=89 height=86 align=left hspace=10>
On the Main Road South of 
Questor's View you will meet Rowe. He's obviously a traitor, so pay attention to his lies.
If you give him 10 Gold Sovereigns, and he will make clear the location of his BARN (where NAGO
and Friends are waiting for you). Don't bother, you can't miss it.<br clear=all><p>
<center><img src="sarth1.gif" width=282 height=107></center><p>
<img src="scroll.gif" width=88 height=53 align=right>
<a name=sarth>
Next stop is SARTH. Don't hurry too much, or you'll miss the GLOVES Chest (containing the
very valuable SKIN OF THE DRAGON Scroll). Look out for a group of two Moredhel Warriors and
a Moredhel Spellcaster <font color=#009900>[Combat 09]</font>.<p>

<img src="marc.gif" width=62 height=82 align=left hspace=10>
Before you enter Sarth, talk
to Brother Marc, who is tending a cornfield near the entrance - he will impart lots of 
information and (for a small fee) improve Owyn's Casting Skill.
He can also sell you FLAMECAST cheaply. You probably already own it, but you can sell it 
at a profit in the Sarth Shop.<p>
Now enter Sarth. The Temple is accessible, but you can not Teleport from (or to) here. You can
enter the <a href="sarthlib.html">Library</a>, and access a lot of useful information by reading
all the books you can find. (In Chapter 6 you'll be able to read a new one.) 
The STARDOCK ANNEX Shop has a number of Spells for sale. At this stage you will almost certainly
have Flamecast, Eyes of Ishap, and Skin of the Dragon. If you can afford it, buy SKYFIRE.<p>

<a name=srthdung>
<center><a href="srthdung.html">MAP OF MINES BELOW SARTH</a></center><p>

<img src="sc.gif" width=92 height=94 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=left>
<img src="sp.gif" width=92 height=94 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=right>
You can also ENTER the Mines below Sarth by clicking the ENTER hotspot left of the Citadel.
You may not be able to access all parts of it at this stage, but you will meet new Enemies!
You can fight two Spiders <font color=#009900>[Combat 01 and Combat 03]</font>, and three
Scorpions <font color=#009900>[Combat 03]</font>. The two Moredhel Chests found here contain
interesting Items.<br clear=all><p>

Exiting Sarth, you will find three Moredhel Chests East of Brother Marc's cornfield.
One of them contains an Amulet of the Upright Man. You'll have to solve a Trap before
approaching these Chests. It's dead easy - make James push the transparent crystal in
front of the blaster. Go on South, towards the Temple of Sung.<p>

<a name=sung>
<center><a href="sung.html">MAP OF SUNG AREA</a></center><p>

You will soon come to the Temple of Sung, only to find that the priests are helpless because of 
the Dream Sender (NAGO) close by. Nago is hiding in Rowe's Barn, with his pals. Go South. Before
you reach the Barn, you will run into two Quegian Pirates <font color=#009900>[Combat 11]</font>.
When you've found the Barn, make sure all the Characters are in tip-top shape, and SAVE!.
Then enter the Barn.<p>

<img src="ng.gif" width=92 height=94 hspace=10 align=left>
Fighting Nago, and his three Moredhel brothers <font color=#009900>[Combat 10]</font> can be tough, especially in Chapter 1, if you
haven't been building your Characters' skills and resources.<p>Remember that Nago can't cast
spells, if somebody is standing next to him. Concentrate on killing Nago as soon as possible.<p>

<font color=#cccc00>
TIP: If you manage to kill Nago, and his companions are still alive, you can RETREAT from the
Combat. You will be able to search Nago's body, but his companions will have retreated to the
Barn, and won't bother you unless you enter again.<p>
</font>

As soon as Nago is dead, go to the Temple of Sung. Owyn will be rewarded with HOCHO'S HAVEN.<p>

You are now approaching Krondor. But first you'll have to fight three Quegian Pirates
<font color=#009900>[Combat 12]</font>, two Quegian Pirates <font color=#009900>[Combat 13]</font>,
and finally a group of two Moredhel Warriors and three Quegian Pirates
<font color=#009900>[Combat 14]</font>. Then enter Krondor. At last.<p>

<font color=#00cccc size=+3>KRONDOR</font><br>
<img src="krondor1.gif" width=277 height=109><p></center>
Once in Krondor, you will find that you cannot enter the Palace.
(The Temple is inaccessible as well.) You will receive hints that you'll have to enter the
Palace via the Sewers, and that James (Jimmy the Hand) is down there. But before you descend,
make sure you check out the Tavern, and the two Shops.<p>

</center>
There is only one possible way up to the Palace, and in order to get the Royal Key of Krondor
<img src="krkey.gif" width=41 height=31 align=right> you will have to find James.
Of course you can explore the Krondor Sewers in detail.<p>
In this Chapter there are not many Enemies in the Sewers. They are all Rogues, except for the
three False Nighthawks <font color=#009900>[Combat 01]</font> you'll have to fight in order to reach James.<p>

<img src="james.gif" width=124 height=103 align=right>

Three Rogues <font color=#009900>[Combat 03]</font><br>

Three Rogues <font color=#009900>[Combat 05]</font><br>
Two Rogues <font color=#009900>[Combat 08]</font><br>
<p>

The are no Moredhel Chests here. The ordinary Chests don't contain much of interest.
There are two Trapped Chests. One <font color=#00cccc>(Skill > 72)</font> contains
SKIN OF THE DRAGON (which you surely have by now).
A Locked Chest <font color=#00cccc>(Skill > 76)</font> in the North-East section contains SKYFIRE, and some Truesight Tea.
At this stage it is not likely that your Lockpicking Skills will suffice to open these Chests.
An Amulet of the Upright Man might do the trick, though!<p>

Once in the Palace, you will meet with Arutha, Prince of Krondor, and Master Magician Pug.<br>
A Moredhel assassin will try to kill Gorath, but his attempt will be foiled by Pug.<p>
<img src="goraface.gif" width=47 height=61> and <img src="owynface.gif" width=47 height=61> will
