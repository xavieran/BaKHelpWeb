<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
I be Seigneur Locklear and I do whatever I will in the Prince's sewers! If you're half as
intelligent as you seem then I would advise you step out of our way.<p>

Fast with a blade I am. Step any further and I'll do you, I will!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
The only thing you will do my young friend is die an unfortunate death on the point of my sword.
I used to spar with Jimmy the Hand and I'm a faster blade than he. Do you still wish to cross me?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LIMM:</font>
Jimmy the Hand? He's a legend, sire. Next you'll be telling me you've lain with the Empress
Lakeisha of Kesh. I'd advise you to be nice like, however cause I got five blokes waiting a 
little on down to make sure nothing happens to me, see. I don't suppose you've come on behalf
of Seigneur James have you?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Seigneur James? Then you don't...well, perhaps we have.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LIMM:</font>
Alright then, down to tacks. If he didn't send you, you'll be answering to the Upright Man and 
not me, so I wash my hands of it. Just watch your steps down here, as there's a bit of trouble 
going on down here. G'day.<p>

Wait...we don't know our way around down here.<p>

Just answer a few questions?<p>

No further, you three. This be the Thieve's Highway and not a one among you looks a Mocker to

And what's to keep me from bringing the Krondorian Lancer Corps down here and crashing your gate?<p>

Same thing as kept every Princes Krondor from doing that very thing. We'd know a week and a day 
before and have time for a nap in between. While they was tromping about down here, we'd be 
looting their houses and their barracks and be all the richer for the expedition.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Fourteen years away and the Mockers are just as I left them. I want you to send word to the 
Upright Man that Seigneur James needs access to the sewers, just for a few hours.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LIMM:</font>
Seigneur James? Oh, well now that's different. You've been all the talk about Mocker's Rest 
for the better part of a two month! The Nightmaster has been right straight that we assist you 
in whatever manner we could.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Why is that?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LIMM:</font>
I'm sure I don't know. I just do as the Nightmaster says. He also said we were to answer any 
questions you might have.

You'll have to be about your business elsewhere, blokes. I'm not to lets so much as a gnat past

Same one as clapped hands on you a few months back. Whoever it was must have had a hand on the 
inside. The Upright Man was poisoned. In the Rest they're calling him The Crawler - still don't 
know what exactly he hopes to gain. We'd never submit to him after all he's done to us. Sooner 
see him dead than in charge of things.

Dropping to a crouch, he pointed down the length of the tunnel and instructed James to walk
away and then return.<p>
"Common problem. You're coming down too much on your heels," Limm said, watching as his pupil
reappeared from the darkness. Grabbing James's foot, he pivoted it so that it rocked from
side to side rather than rear to front. Imagine your feet are like waves. You have to let 'em 
roll. Down on the outside, then roll to the center. Now go down and back. We'll keep this up 
'til you have it."<p>
After a few more trials, James began to catch on to the technique. "Astonishing how much of a 
difference it makes. I could barely hear myself."<p>

We can still chat a bit if you like."

You're in Mocker territory. I'd advise you turn about and leave before I'm forced to do you a 
good bit of harm.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Please, if you could just answer a few questions for us then we will be out of here.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LIMM:</font>
Questions?! Only thing as concerns me is getting the mess from the storm taken care of and 
getting us all back on our collective feet. Ordinarily we don't objects to a storm nows and
then - cleans the smell out if you know what I mean. But this storm, it did us a piece all
right. Water come in from the seas and washed a score of us into the ocean, destroyed our 
headquarters and ruined our plan to take care of a little local problem. And we almost had him.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Him? Who did you almost have?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LIMM:</font>
The Crawler, that's who, not that it concerns you anyway. Once he had the Upright Man out of
his way, I guess he decided that it was time to come round and claim his prize. We had other 
ideas course. We had a handy little trap all baited for him, one such like he couldn't refuse.
Would have had him scurrying back to the Sunset Isles or wherever else in the seven lower hells 
he came from. Unfortunately the weather didn't cooperate with our little plan.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Are any of your Mockers magicians?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LIMM:</font>
No, at least none that admits it freely. Sooner cut a magician's throat than let him among us, 
but if truth be known we would have welcomed one this past few months. Some of the Crawler's men
are magic types.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Are they? Any of them left down here?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LIMM:</font>
Who's to say? We're still picking through our own dead, much less worried about which of them
were still here. Large portions of the sewers are collapsed. There's even word that when a 
portion of the sea wall collapsed, it opened a new stairwell to a lower level of the sewers.

<font color=#ffcc00>LIMM:</font>
Look, unless you're willing to help clean up this mess down here, I'd shag a behind to get out 
of here. I'm not the type as to kill people I don't know at the drop of a hat, but not so many 
of our Mocker brethren are so agreeably disposed. Get my meaning? Split before you get split.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Could we at least ask you a few questions?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LIMM:</font>
Sounds to me like you just did... What you want to know?

What do you know about an object called the Idol of Lassur?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LIMM:</font>
Some sort of kid story, it'n it? About a whizit or other what gives you the power over the
Goddess of Death, or some such silliness.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Why would anyone be looking for it in Krondor?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LIMM:</font>
Part of the story, as I remember it. It was supposed to have been hidden away in some deep and 
secret part of the sewers by this Keshian, what? Something like that. But it's not real, I can 
guarantee that. If it'd existed, the Mockers would have found it by now.<p>

Do what you like, pointy ears, just get out of the sewers afore someone decides to make a meat
pie out of you.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Believe me, I have no burning desire to stay down here. I for one will be quite happy if I never
see the underside of Krondor again. Goodbye, Limm, and good luck.

Surprised your head hasn't popped open, all the knowledge you've got up there. Have to be a 
right genius.<p>

Goodbye, Limm. Try not to steal anything that you can't carry.
