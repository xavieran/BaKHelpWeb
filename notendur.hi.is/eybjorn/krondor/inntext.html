Common vs. Rare:<br>
Many special Inn Dialogues, i.e. Chapter-restricted and Quest-triggered ones,
will be found in the Chapter and Zone pages. All others are generated randomly,
some being "common", while others are "rare". A "common" dialogue is one regularly
encountered in most Inns. "Rare" dialogues are much less frequent,
and some may be rarer than others, being further restricted by location
and chapter.

<font size=-1 color=#999999><b>
Man vs. Patron:<br>
Generally, a Patron is a person with a "special" type of Dialogue, including
NPCs (see NPC pages) and Gamblers. The Patron type of
Dialogue shown below indicates that the Patron, although he won't tell you
anything of importance at the moment, will definitely have more to say at
another stage of the game (dependent on Chapter or Quest).

They scrutinized the building.<br>
"Looks like we ve found an inn," Locklear said with a smile, indicating the tiny 
ribbons that had been pinned to the building's frame. "Those offerings to the 
protector goddess are as good as a traveller's seal of approval. Should be a 
good place to stay."<p>

Locklear pushed the door open.<br>
As he passed through, he noted the lack of a door latch, a sign the inn was likely chartered by 
the local lord to ensure the safety of travellers. Hopefully, it would also mean the inn's 
furnishings would be suitable.

</td><td valign=top>
<b>

The building's windows were shoddy.<br>
"Even money says it's a tavern," Locklear said. "You don't pay much for windows when 
you have to replace them often."<p>

Locklear sniffed.<br>
Stepping just inside the tavern's doorway, he detected the faint but familiar scent of lye and 
the more pungent aromas they were meant to erase. It would be a foolish tavern keeper who
neglected to have a cleaningboy close at hand where men drank to excess.<p>

<font color=#cc0000>
IF CLOSED:</font><p>

Locklear rapped on the tavern door.<br>
When it was apparent no one was coming to open up, Locklear shrugged. "Well, it would seem the
common folk have taken Prince Arutha's laws to heart. Doors only open from midday to midnight,"
he said with a sigh. "But I suppose someone had to ensure the farmers weren't drinking when they
should be in the fields. Sometimes he really takes all the fun out of life..."

"[X] sovereigns for the night," he grumbled. "Though, if you louse my

Locklear settled up the account.<p>
"Room's upstairs," the nightmaster said. "Have a good rest."<p>
The room was cramped. Shrugging, Owyn stepped over snoring bodies and 
selected a spot of floor which looked like it might be comfortable for 
the night, while Gorath squeezed into a bed already occupied by three 
disheveled looking men. "Ah, the romance of travelling," Owyn said, 
with a chuckle. "See you all in the morning." In moments, they were all 
fast asleep.

The innkeeper frowned.<p>
"Let me guess," he said, reading Locklear's distressed face as he 
searched his pack for the money. "You haven't any money but you just 
need someplace to bed down for the night because you're being chased by 
some mob of ruffians and you'll be eternally in my debt if I just let 
you stay the night. Right?"<p> 
"I truly thought I had the funds," Locklear said.<p>
"Hundreds of men are eternally in my debt but they don't pay the bills. 
Get out of here." Graciously the innkeeper escorted them to the door.

Locklear frowned.<p>
"Another time, nightmaster," he said, rapping a knuckle against the 
counter. "A bit of advice, however. You want more customers, I'd advise 
dropping your prices. Even the Empress of Kesh would balk at what 
you're asking."

Intrigued, Locklear checked to make certain the nightmaster wasn't coming,

travelling names.<p>

Still feeling light headed from his well-earned sleep, he waited

"You seem to be in a good mood," the man said, picking up the guest 
register. Locklear replied only by nodding noncommittally, knowing the 
innkeeper might increase his rates if he seemed too pleased with the 
service. "Seeing as how you slept so well, how about another night?" 
the nightmaster asked. "And just to show you how generous I am, I'll 
keep the same rate. [X] sovereigns per night. What do you say?"

Locklear drummed his fingers on the counter.<p>

"Excellent," James intoned with false sincerity. "I don't know when 
I've had a better sleep. That was, of course, when I could get to 
sleep. What were you doing down here, skinning cats?"<p>
A deep blush spread across the innkeeper's face. "I had company. It's

Daylight arrived.<p>
His eyes rimmedred and his stomach turning, James stumbled down the 
steps to find the inn's nightmaster. Angrily, he pounded on the 
counter.<p>
"Yes?" the man said, glaring at James. "What is it?"<p>
"One of your patrons last night must have had some kind of sickness. I've been 
emptying my guts in your bedpans all morning."<p>
The nightmaster looked unsympathetic. "I shall have to see they are 
cleaned out." Glancing down at his guest book, he ran his finger down 
the names. "I still seem to have space available this evening. Shall you 
be staying again?"

</td><td valign=top>

The nightmaster was waiting.<p>
"There is a message for you," he said, seeing Locklear. Reaching beneath 
the counter, he produced [x] sovereigns. "One of the guests that was here 
last night told me to give you these and tell you they are a gift from 
Delekhan."<p>
Locklear froze, his hand clasped over the coins. "Anything else?"<p>
"No, that was it," the man said cheerfully. "Just give them these coins 
and tell them it was from Delekhan. So, how about spending a little of 
that new found fortune on another night here, eh? That will more than 
cover the cost."

"So, where are you headed?" the man asked, describing a large arc with his ale

drunken blubber, it became evident the man had no intention of finishing the

"That's terrible," Locklear intoned a round a mouthful of bread, his attention fixed 
instead on the wooden boards behind the mercenarys head. "Awful. Tragic..."<p>
"Ah, there you are," a steward said, laying a heavy hand on Owyn's

Owyn clapped his hands together. "Yes, yes, of course. If our drinking

Locklear slapped the man on the back.<p> 
Immediately he regretted doing so as the mercenary gasped, his face contorting

"I'm sorry. I didn't realize... Is your shoulder broken?" Locklear asked.<p>
"Don't worry yourself about it," the man spat between gritted teeth. "I haven't 
exactly made the fact known." A faint popping sound issued from the man's back 
as he moved his shoulder, tears forming in the corners of his eyes. "I was a 
courier for the dwarves. I reasoned there would be less chance a brigand would 
try to intercept me if he wasn't aware I was injured."<p>
Locklear nodded sympathetically. "Did you break it in a fight?"<p>
"No, a fall," the man said. "Stupid man I am, I was in the dwarven caves and I 
came to this pit -- part of the caves had collapsed so there were all kinds of 
sinkholes everywhere. Since there wasn't a plank I could walk over and I didn't 
have any kind of rope...I jumped. I think if I had the chance to make the

The man kept Locklear laughing.<p>
After a string of bawdy tales about mercenaries and blushing maidens, he 
launched into a tale about a lord's daughter he'd once tried to win, though 
with quite a bit of resistance from a man named Luc.<p>
"He demanded to arm wrestle you for the girl?"<p>
"Actually, no. Alas, it was the girl's idea," the man sighed.<p>
"I'd have strangled her!" Locklear said with a laugh, holding his sides. "Ah well, I 
don't suppose you can win them all."<p>
"Oh but I did win," the man continued, a malicious grin spreading across his 
face. "The girl knew Luc was the strongest man in the village and so did I, had 
known it for several days once I'd found out who all her possible suitors were. 
Any way, I had visited an herb shop and picked up a vial of some wonderful stuff 
called Fadamor's Formula, a potion which I'd heard mercenaries say helped 
sustain their strength during long fights. I waited until a few moments before 
the contest before downing it because I knew it would last only a short 
while. I marched in, sat down at the table, and very nearly took the poor 
fellow's arm off. When it seemed his personal honor was at stake, I took him 
aside and told him I would let him soundly beat me in front of everyone and let 
him have the girl if he gave me half the amount of the dowry. Half an hour 
later, I was a very wealthy man."

The man belched.<p>
Though not initially in the most companionable mood, he eventually gave in to 
Locklear's attempts to make conversation and told a story about a foiled robbery 
thanks to the sword skills of his brother-in-law.<p>
"Sounds like it's lucky you had him along," Locklear said.<p>
"Hmm. Probably, but if he hadn't been out looking for one of those bloody damned 
fairy chests, we'd have been to LaMut on time. Could've watched Earl Kasumi and 
the rest of those Tsurani warriors of his humiliating Baron Gabot's men in the 
archer's tourney. That must have been quite a sight, especially since the Baron 
himself is generally considered an archer only second to Duke Martin of Crydee."<p>
"Fairy chests?" Locklear interrupted.<p>
"Treasure chests," the man clarified with a scowl. "Not that I ever believed we 
would find one, but he says they are usually hidden in out of the way fields or 
back in little canyons. Only a damn fool would believe something as stupid as 
that, but I suppose I should expect as much from any husband of my sister."

The mercenary demanded ale.<p>
Initially suspicious of Locklear, he began to loosen up as his drink took hold, 
speaking eventually at length about his colorful career as a Midkemian 
freebooter.<p>
"So, how did you get the scar?" Locklear said, commenting on the red slash which 
traced the man's jawline. "Escaping from a Quegian press gang?"<p>
"Nothing so daring," the man laughed, speaking into his ale cup. "Though I shall 
have to remember that one when next I have the chance to show it off at court. 
No, I simply ran afoul of a group of bravos who were bucking for a reward at the 
Mac Mordain Cadal. They didn't wish to have the competition and so we 
had...words."<p>
"Must have been pretty sharp words, Locklear said. "What was the reward for?"<p>
The man shrugged. "Some monster the dwarves called a Brock Noor or something of 
that nature. Apparently they couldn't split up their time between trying to kill 
the thing and digging out a mine shaft collapse the thing had caused. So, they 
called in mercenaries for help."

Turning so his face could only be seen by the man whom he had approached, Locklear
greeted the man loudly, then pitched his voice lower, "Are you a swordsman or a 
storyteller?"<p>
A smirk appeared on the man's lips. "And what makes you think I am either?"<p>
"Because when a common room falls this unnervingly quiet, it means the locals 
expect either a fight or a tale," Locklear muttered. "So which is it to be?"<p>
Looking down at the counter near his elbow, the man sighed. "Seeing as how I've 
left my sword at home and I've only a butter knife at my immediate disposal...I 
suppose a tale to pass the time would be more prudent at this juncture."<p>
Mostly his stories were about battles, large and small, fought sometimes for 
fame and glory but always for the coin of the right color. He had travelled up 
and down the Kingdom of the Isles, but never had he found a minute's peace in 
any place that he slept. When at last he had come to the conclusion of his 
storytelling, he thanked Locklear for listening then stumbled off looking for 
something closely resembling a bed.

spell on them, the bemused looking fellow merely withdrew a pipe from his belt

Their company was welcomed reluctantly.<p>
In a generally foul mood, the man had a list of complaints about things in the

"He tried to saddle me with one of those moredhel blades," the man said, taking

"What's wrong with using a lamprey?" Locklear asked.<p>
"Too long," the man said, "You take a moredhel or an elf like your friend here, 
it's the perfect length and balance for their reach, but for a human or Tsurani 
-- damn hard to control the thing. Same thing's true of a Griefmaker or any 
other elven blade."<p>
"Such as?" Locklear pressed. Immediately he sensed that his drinking companion was 
growing suspicious, and so he quickly amended his question. "Forgive me, but 
I've only recently purchased a shop of my own and I don't know much about 
weapons. I want to make certain that I buy weapons my customers can use, not 
just pretty trinkets."<p>
"Understandable." Putting down his cup, the man ticked off names on his fingers 
as he recalled the other makes. "First off, I know a greatsword is of elven 
manufacture and I think a few goblin stickers are also made by the fair folk, 
though I couldn't be certain of it. Humans also seem to have a little difficulty

James' eyes widened, knowing immediately what the man had faced. "They're called 
Black Slayers," he explained. "They're a Nighthawk that's nearly impossible to 
kill. If this assassin wanted you dead, why didn't he kill you then?"<p>

out a handful of cracked seashells, handing them over to Locklear to examine.<p>
"Have you tried to sell them to a merchant somewhere?" Locklear asked.<p>
"A few places, but I've found they won't buy anything they don't already have on 
their shelves. Why do they just need more of what they already have? I would 
think they would jump at the chance to stock items they don't have around."<p>
Locklear shrugged and handed the shells back. "I'm no merchant, but it might be a

been inclined to agree," the woman said with a nod. "Fortunately, he isn't very 
good about sticking to the subject and he covers more territory than the birds 
he writes about. I've learned some miraculous things about trading with 
shopkeepers and playing the lute -- I would highly recommend you find the time

Owyn coughed.<p>
"You should see a priest about that," the woman said. "How long have you been 
afflicted with it?"<p>
"Only just now. I have a small problem with smoke." Owyn replied, gesturing to the 
corner of the tavern where a wood fire was burning in the hearth. "I doubt the 
brothers of Sung would be much interested."<p>
She nodded, staring down into the dregs of her winecup. "Unless you've a mortal 
wound or a plague or you've been stupid enough to fall prey to poison, I've 
never found that priests are of much use other than to babble on about the 
trivial."

WOMAN: RARE DIALOGUE (only in Silden?)</b></font>

<blockquote>

The woman talked.<p>
Brushing away the hair that was dangling in her eyes, she talked long and 
passionately about the affairs of the common folk of Midkemia.<p>
"You talk of children as if they were nothing more than pieces on a chessboard," 
Locklear said with a frown.<p>
"Forgive me, sire, but I was lowborn," she replied. "When a farmer has no one to 
push his plow for him and cannot hire a strong back, he and his wife conceive a 
child! When a noble is endangered by ships off his coast, but has a daughter in 
swaddling that coos in her bassinet, he promises her hand in marriage to the 
invading lord to save his gold! It is the nature of your Great Freedom..."<p>
Stunned by the flare of rage, Locklear was uncertain how to answer the peasant woman's 
vehemence. "It is not my plan, miss," he replied pointedly. "And I don't think 
it was engineered to enslave children, however good your point may be. Yes, many 
people are forced to do much against their will, but how eager do you think 
the soldiers have been that have gone down to their deaths to defend those 
principles? There are prices to be paid on all sides."<p>
"Yes, there are," she said. "But some of us seem to be paying more than others."
