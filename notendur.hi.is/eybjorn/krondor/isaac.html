Locklear smiled.<p>

Although the approaching man seemed half a hand shorter for the passage of eleven years, his 
halting stride was still as personal to him as his signature. Ages past Isaac had suffered his 
limp proudly, worn it like an injury sustained on a field of battle and for that he had gained 
the respect and admiration of Krondor's young squires, Locklear among them. His tragic expulsion
from Arutha's court had been a blow to them all.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ISAAC:</font>
The years have worn you well old squire, despite the fact it seems to have darkened your hair a 
bit. What did you do? Stick your head in a barrel of pitch?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Scoundrel, I would have thought you strung up for impersonating a Duke by now! How are you,
Isaac?! It's been since Arutha' s wedding, hasn't it?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ISAAC:</font>
The very day. You should have heard the fit Master of Ceremonies deLacy threw when he found out 
I wasn't the Count of Dorgin's son. I daresay he would have tossed me over the palace walls 
himself if he hadn't been busy with the details of the blessed event. I've kept busy since then,
spent the last few years on the road doing odd jobs along the border. You'd be surprised at all 
the things I've learned and seen since I've left Krondor.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Surprise me then. You alway were a rumormonger.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ISAAC:</font>
Well...what would you like to know about?

I thought you were off to meet with Prince Arutha.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
So did I, but we've been muddling about here taking care of a few other errands. It's just luck 
we happened on you again.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ISAAC:</font>
I shall consider it good fortune then. So, what can I do for you?

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
I've just returned from a military assignment and it's imperative that I get south as soon and
as inconspicuously as possible. Are there any places you think we should avoid?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ISAAC:</font>
At all costs, you'll want to avoid the road from Eggley to Tanneurs. There is a festival to be 
held in Eggley and it's likely your elven companion would be spotted right away.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
What makes you think we're off to Krondor?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ISAAC:</font>
Elves don't come much out of Elvandar and they are even less likely to travel in the company of
a boy and seigneur when they do take to voyaging. Whatever you three are about, I assumed it 
must involve the good of the Kingdom. Krondor would be the only logical place for you to go.<p>

No... For a fact I can't say that I have, but a certain pokiir player that I lost a great deal
of money to in Eggley comes to mind. Name of Devon, I believe. It took me quite a while to make
up the funds I lost during a single night playing against him. He very nearly took every
sovereign I'd made in a month's time.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Did you by any chance purchase a ruby from Keifer Alescook in Loriel? He told us he sold it to 
someone named Isaac and the description he gave us sounded like you.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ISAAC:</font>
Why? You want to buy it from me? It's not like it's the only ruby in the world you know...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
The ruby he sold you was stolen from a Tsurani magician who was passing through LaMut. The 
Garrison would like the stone back. We were hoping we could talk you into at least returning it 
to Keifer to get your money back.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ISAAC:</font>
I'm sorry to hear about your dilemma, but I had no idea the stone was stolen when I paid 
Keifer's price and I have my own little problem. I need the stone so I can pay off a sword 
crafter and get my blade repaired.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Can't you pay him with gold?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ISAAC:</font>
He specifically barters in gems and the ruby will cover my costs plus a little more. I should 
have enough left over to eat for a month or more.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
What if we can repair your sword for you?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ISAAC:</font>
What, here? In the middle of the road?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Since I don't have a workshop, I don't see that we can do it anywhere else.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ISAAC:</font>
Well...I suppose. My blade is fairly expensive and I'd hate to see it further damaged. It's
conceivable you could do more harm than good, so unless you're really skilled at
weaponcraft...well... Do you really think you're that good?<p>

<blockquote>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
We met your pokiir playing friend in Eggley and he told us a bit about the match he played with 
you. He told us about the elven friends that came along with you, but as you pointed out before,
elves rarely come out of Elvandar and would be very unlikely to be travelling from town to town 
playing pokiir. Talk, Isaac. Why are you working with the moredhel, Isaac? What are they doing 
in the Kingdom?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ISAAC:</font>
I don't seem to be the only one keeping company with them, seigneur...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
I'm not in a mood to be trifled with, Isaac. Talk!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ISAAC:</font>
Seeing as how they've seen fit to dismiss me, I can't see it will hurt matters. They're
operating out of a barn near Yellow Mule. I found an old farmer there who wasn't particular
about who rented his land and harbored loyalty to neither his lord nor to the Prince. A moredhel
named Nago moved in there and has been using it as a base of operations to hire Quegian 
mercenaries.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Makes sense. Mercenaries would be able to move in the Kingdom without being noticed. What are 
they planning?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ISAAC:</font>
I made it a policy not to know. Knowledge has a tendency to shorten your life, especially when 
you're working with lunatics. Think what you like, but this was purely a business transaction. 
They paid me and I made the pick-ups and drop-offs to the moredhel lockchests. That was all I 
did for them.<p>

Trouble. He's a magician, well armed, and was carrying enough gold in sovereigns to hire several
dozen Quegian Mercenaries for months. Rowe nearly fainted when Nago handed over a pouch with 
four hundred golden sovereigns.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Rowe?<p>

What were your last orders before Nago released you?<p>

I released myself. I had the feeling I was coming to the end of my usefulness to the moredhel 
and I made my plans accordingly. When they asked me to pick up a ruby from Keifer Alescook and 
deliver it to a specific moredhel lockchest, I realized they were planning to take care of two 
problems at the same time. The moredhel courier would an assassin. They had planned to kill me 
and, at the same time, erase any evidence to whom the ruby had been delivered.<p>

You assume those traps were laid for you. Perhaps they were laid there to prevent someone in

Invasion? Don't be absurd! The Northlands are in a state of civil war. They would be completely

were shadow, candle, stranger...no...die, spider, key and...what?
Shadow...candle...stranger...spider...key... I'm sorry, but I can't remember the sixth one. I
know one of the moredhel had problems remembering the same one and carved the name onto one of 
the headstones near LaMut.<p>
