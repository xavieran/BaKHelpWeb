THE CHAPTER BEGINS<br>
</font>
</center>

<blockquote>

Locklear's eyes hardened.<p>

At some level he wanted to believe he'd seen something in the instant 
of the gate's collapse. It was irrational, no doubt a vision he had 
conjured for himself to soften the blow of Patrus' death. As a man who 
had stood against many armies, Locklear knew all too well about last 
second visions seen on the battlefield. There was absolutely no chance 
that Patrus could have survived the blast. None.<p>

By some agency beyond his control, he turned back the melancholy that 
threatened to overtake him, rationality brooking his grief for the lost 
magician. There was still an army to contend with, still moredhel to 
slay, still a Kingdom to defend. There would be time for grieving when 
it was finished.<p>

"Such a dumb way to die," Locklear said, biting off the words bitterly.<p>

Seigneur James nodded. "He died a good death, Locky. I wouldn't have 
wished for him to go, but he died to save others."<p>

"You say that all the time, James, but there's no good way to die. 
They're all bad."<p>

James stared at his old friend and saw the coldness that glimmered in 
Locklear's gaze. He had come to know that look over the years, an 
expression that had first manifested itself at the Battle of Armengar 
years before when Locklear's girlfriend, Bronwynn, had been slain by 
a troll. A bit of Locky had died then and in that place had grown the 
seed that had bloomed into a deadly and superior knight. But in all 
that time, he had never forgiven himself for letting the girl die.<p>

"You're not mad Patrus is dead," James said finally. "You're angry that 
you didn't die in his place.<p> 

Locklear's eyes flashed protest, but suddenly he reached for his sword 
as three flashes appeared in the woods...<p>

"Spellweavers!" Locklear shouted.<p>

Disliking the fact that they would be at a disadvantage against a 
magical opponent without Patrus, James steeled himself as he grabbed 
for his weapon...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
Stay your swords, Seigneurs. I believe it is still considered rude in 
the Kingdom to skewer your friends.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Duke Pug! Never have I been half so relieved to see a friendly face. We 
were expecting moredhel magicians...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
Tsurani magicians, James, or rather magicians trained by a Tsurani. No 
moredhel witch would have the capability to make a rift machine nor 
would they chance going into battle with such poor odds of success.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
I still should like to know how exactly it was that Delekhan managed to 
make contact with Makala? I had hoped that the moredhel would be wary 
of another such attack following the defeat of Murmandamus ten years 
ago.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Prince Arutha said they hope to find Murmandamus and free him. The 
moredhel are convinced we've been holding him captive all these long 
years.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
So Gorath has told me. Doubtless Makala exploited that belief to his 
advantage. That at least explains one wrinkle. The moredhel have never 
forgiven us for that loss.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
But why is Makala doing all of this? Obviously he isn't in this to 
rescue a dead moredhel leader.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
For the moment I believe I know, but I don't wish to say until I have 
taken a better look at something. This last problem I will have to 
unravel myself, with some assistance from Gorath and Owyn.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
From here I think we will be able to teleport into the caverns beneath 
Sethanon. It is there our objective lies.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
What of Locklear and myself?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
Once Prince Arutha arrives with his reinforcements, deliver my 
assurance that he will not face anything magical from the moredhel. If 
Makala indeed has assistants, they will be uninterested in the Prince.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
They will be waiting for me.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
It is much the same as the magical perimeters the Timirianyan gods use. Makala must have learned
their nature while he was there.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Can you disassemble it?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
Not directly. We will have to go to the source of its generation and eliminate the problem there.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
So if we find Makala, we'll be able to remove it.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
No. Makala is already within, investigating the Lifestone as we speak. He will have spellweavers
scattered through this location to maintain a shield of this power. I don't think he was
absolutely certain that I would have found the cup.<p> 

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
So he knew you were going to find it?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
About two years ago, he was absent from Midkemia for a number of months - shortly after I 
informed him that I would divulge no more about this chamber and the events at the end of the 
Great Uprising of the moredhel. When he reappeared, he dismissed his absence saying that he had 
been travelling.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
So you think he ran across the cup himself?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
Among other things. It's the only way he could have known about its powers and left it for me 
to discover. It is also probably about the time he decided to make contact with the
moredhel... It's time we found the Six.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Delekhan's magical assistants?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
Not having seen them, I can't be certain whether they are native or not, but I suspect they 
aren't moredhel spellweavers, despite whatever appearance they may be using. Makala has played 
your ruler for a fool. Delekhan won't stand to benefit in the slightest from this raid, despite 
anything Makala might have indicated... Enough speculation... The sooner we find the Six, the 
sooner we can get this shield down.<p>

</td><td valign=top>
<b>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
I don't know what it was you were thinking, Owyn, but as you see, the barrier is still here. 
We will have to find the Six and convince them to drop this shield.<p> 

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
You mean kill them?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
If they are Tsurani as I suspect, it is very probable. Let's get to finding them...<p>

Pug searched his memory.<p>
His faculties still clouded by the residual effects of his encounter on Timirianya, he tried to 
remember the exact sequence of passageways in the ancient Valheru ruins.<p>
Seeing the master magician's dazed expression, Owyn tugged on his sleeve. "Are we going to go 
down to another level?" he asked.<p>

<font color=#cc0000 size=+1>
YES:</font><p>

Gorath looked up the narrow stairwell.<p>
It was definitely a way up, but he questioned whether it was the right way for them to be going

other level?"<p>

<font color=#cc0000 size=+1>
YES:</font><p>

Pug nearly broke his neck.<p>
Less footsure than Gorath and further encumbered by his bulky staff, it was a constant struggle 
for him to keep upright as they wound up the mossy steps...

<font color=#ffcc00>ORACLE:</font>
I called for you but was unable to reach your mind. The magician wields an amulet which renders 
this body feeble and he is in the process of disabling the last of the defenses which ring the 
Lifestone.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
Makala is reckless, but I do not think he will have crippled you permanently. He must have 
unearthed some Valheru artifact, likely a product of Lyron-Baktos, the Master of Dragons. While 
he would be incapable of ruling your mind, he could still command your dragon's flesh.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ORACLE:</font>
My inability to know my own future blinded us to the possibility.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
It's something we will have to attend to later... Gorath, I wish you to stay here and guard the 
Oracle.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ORACLE:</font>
Thank you. It pains me that protection is necessary.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Pug, you may require my strength when you reach the Tsurani magician...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ORACLE:</font>
You <i>will</i> have a difficult time in the Lifestone chamber.<p> 

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
No Gorath. You have already given too much to this quest and seen what should have been seen by 
no one other than myself. You would never so much as scratch Makala's skin before he burned you 
to cinders. He will be more respectful in the presence of magicians and less likely to do 
anything rash. For now, you have a responsibility to guard the Oracle.<p>

PUG/OWYN DIALOGUE (INVALID?)</b></font>
</td></tr></table>
</center>

<blockquote>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
Before we move any further, I am of a mind to prepare you for what we are going to encounter. 
Located in these chambers is an artifact known as the Lifestone, crafted by the ancient Valheru.
It has powers beyond even my comprehension, but we know that it was crafted for the purpose of 
great destruction. It was this that the false Murmandamus sought to achieve during the Great 
Uprising.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
False Murmandamus? What do you mean?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
He was not truly moredhel. He was a Pantathian who took on the semblance of a moredhel so he 
could achieve his goal. The point is irrelevant. What he sought was to activate the Lifestone. 
If that had happened, the devastation of Timirianya would seem a garden compared to what would 
be left of Midkemia.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
If the Valheru are dead, what does it matter? If no one knows how to use it, then it can't be 
of any danger to us.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
Not so. The souls of the Valheru are bound to the stone and it may be that tampering with it 
may allow them to emerge once more, perhaps even to inhabit a living body. Even in a symbiotic 
state, we have no certain way of knowing what destruction they would be capable of.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
So Makala wants to destroy everything?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
He is not mad, but his curiosity may lead to more trouble than he imagines. Hopefully, we can 
find and stop him before he can do anything catastrophic.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
But why tell us about any of this? I'm a squire from Tiburn and Gorath is a renegade from the 
Northlands. Isn't that dangerous?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
Your stations are unimportant. I was once a kitchen boy in the court of Crydee. I trust you 
because apparently Macros prefigured your involvement in this and did nothing to warn me before 
he left Midkemia. For whatever reason, I think he believes it necessary you be involved in these
events and he invariably acts for the greater good, however mysterious his reasons may be.<p>

THE LIFESTONE CHAMBER</b></font>

<blockquote>

Pug hurried Owyn under an archway.<p>

The corridor angled sharply downward, its rough earthen floor littered with a slippery ceramic 
material which cracked underfoot with each step taken. In places, the boy glimpsed ancient 
frescoes of a moredhel-looking race who stared back at him with eyes filled with enigmatic hate,
the cause of which had been millions of years dead.<p>

Following a slow bend, they arrived at last at what looked to be a stone wall, but quickly Pug 
muttered a few words and the door shimmered away into nothingness. Beyond lay a vast chamber, 
and Makala was waiting for them.<p>

</blockquote><center>
<img src="divsmall.gif" width=375 height=9>
</center><blockquote>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
I hoped more for you, Makala. When first you came to us years ago from the Assembly I sensed 
your heart full of dark calculation, but I had thought with us you would grow to gentleness.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAKALA:</font>
We Tsurani are of course bereft of that quality.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
Save your prating for the Assembly! You have returned my friendship with cold contempt, treated 
with my daughter as a wolf to his prey and have defied my interdict to visit Sethanon. Assume 
nothing between us now other than the respect due between practitioners. Why has the Assembly of
Magicians seen fit to interpose itself into Midkemian affairs?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAKALA:</font>
As a whole, the Assembly was unable to reach consensus on this matter; they hesitate to dabble 
in matters that might arouse your ire. Otherwise disposed with a small problem concerning House 
Acoma they decided those who felt this investigation necessary could conduct it of their own 
volition. I undertook that responsibility.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
I should be careful taking such weight upon your shoulders. It may yet crush you.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAKALA:</font>
Ten years ago you engaged in a battle to bar the Valheru entrance to your world, a battle in 
which you requested the service of several companies of Tsurani foot soldiers. As such, the 
battle became a matter of imperial interest and fell within the jurisdiction of the Assembly. 
You, however, have thwarted all our efforts to gather information about that battle and have 
forbade our investigation of Sethanon. Many sons of great houses fell but their bodies were 
never recovered for the proper rites.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
Your attempts at evasion are execrable, Makala! Never has the Assembly concerned itself with the
souls of the dead and I don't believe they are practicing a new found piety. You wished to learn
how I defeated the Valheru.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAKALA:</font>
Indeed. How could we not? The Valheru were a race of unspeakable evil and dread power who once 
nearly destroyed our world. Although my brothers harbor you the greatest respect Pug, you would 
be incapable of turning aside such monstrous power unaided. Judging by the numerous defenses 
that ringed this abandoned town, we assumed the only possible solution. You concealed a thing of
power in the caverns here.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
I cannot fault your fears, but your methodology has been despicable. The Lifestone was created 
in the darkest days of the Mad God's Rage, a war in which the Valheru strove to destroy the gods
of Midkemia. With it they believed they could conquer every corner of the universe, and in all 
likelihood, they could have. It must be eternally locked away here and its existence must die 
out with that small handful of us that have looked upon it. You will speak to none of the 
Assembly about what you have found here or you shall answer to me.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAKALA:</font>
I cannot in good conscience keep such a secret. What if such a weapon were wielded against the 
Empire? Could not such a weapon lay waste to all her children? We cannot simply bury such a 
weapon. It must be destroyed for the good of all future generations of the Empire and the 
Kingdom.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
Impossible. We have no way to know what would happen if we attempted to destroy it. It may not 
be tested without potentially disturbing the Valheru whose souls now occupy the stone.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAKALA:</font>
As I suspected. You have done nothing to study it. Great though your power may be, you haven't 
an inkling what secrets lie within that stone. It's very existence is obscene! It must not fall 
into the hands of a hostile power.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
Makala, do not tamper with the stone. It must be left untouched for the good of all!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAKALA:</font>
I judge now as is my right as a Great One of the Assembly of Magicians. It must be destroyed,
Pug ... <i>for the good of the Empire!</i><p>

Makala raised his staff.<p>

Not wanting to strike down the Tsurani, but realizing the choice was being made for him, Pug

ability. Perhaps between he and the boy, they could still defeat Makala.<p>

THE GAME ENDS<br>

<blockquote>

The Lifestone pulsed warmth.<p>

Rays of emerald light touched Owyn's solemn features, deepening the 
hollows of his face as he approached the blasted turf occupied moments 
before by Makala's towering rage. Nearby, Pug spoke softly, his voice 
diffusing off the cavern walls into a thousand bouncing whispers.<p>

"It may be difficult," Pug said, "but don't judge him too harshly,
Owyn. I have performed acts nearly as monstrous in the name of common 
good."<p>

"I find that hard to believe," Owyn replied. "You're a good man."<p>

"So was he, in his own way. Loyalty can sometimes misguide even the
finest of men..."<p>

Both magicians flinched in unison as muted sword strikes erupted in the 
corridors outside the chamber. With startling rapidity the sounds 
approached, dissolved into pattering desperate footfalls and howling 
half-screamed oaths.<p>

"Watch yourself!" Pug shouted across the cavern. "Someone's coming!"<p>

Harried by a shadowy assailant Gorath backed into the chamber, his 
sword flying in a defensive arc before him. Repeatedly, razor-like 
fists flashed out of the darkness to challenge him, but he skillfully 
turned the attacks to his advantage. Finding the rhythm of his 
opponent, he feinted right when he was expected to move left and a 
warrior barreled past him.<p>

"Delekhan!" Owyn exclaimed.<p>

Tripped up by Gorath, the moredhel leader crashed to the ground, 
snarling all the while in slavering fury. Attempting to rise, he 
slashed upward with his gauntleted fist but brutally Gorath stepped 
inside his guard and delivered a rain of heavy kicks until the older 
warrior fell quiet.<p>

"I suggest you lie still," Gorath snapped, wiping rivulets of blood from 
his face. "I may decide to kill you yet."<p>

"I hear you," Delekhan croaked, his voice weak. For a long moment he 
remained curled in a ball, his breath tearing raggedly from his throat 
as he clenched and unclenched his fists. With extreme effort he turned 
his head and looked upon the mesmerizing light of the Lifestone and 
froze.<p>

"No!" Pug shook his head, apprehension welling within him like a black 
lake as he caught the moredhel's expression. Stumbling forward he tried 
to interpose himself in the way but his failing strength abandoned him.
"No!"<p>

Swatting Gorath effortlessly aside as he rose, Delekhan's eyes flashed 
with reflected radiance. Like a puppet on a string, he began to stagger 
forward, his steps almost childish in their plodding. Undoubtedly 
something had control of his mind...<p>

Dazed but alive, Gorath leapt to the attack and jolted hard into the 
moredhel leader, his miscalculated blow carrying the both of them not 
down but forward, forward into the Lifestone...<p>

Together they reached for the sword.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DELEKHAN:</font>

Kingdom to warn us and we killed him."<p>

"Don't be petulant, Owyn. This isn't a time for it."<p>

Glaring at Pug with shock, Owyn opened his mouth to reply, but found 
that adequate words failed him. Angered, he turned as if to leave, but 
felt the master magician's hand on his shoulder.<p>

"Wait," Pug said, his voice more gentle than it had been. Meeting the 
boy's hateful gaze, he motioned for him to stay. "You must understand. 
Gorath was dead the minute he touched the sword. If we had hesitated 
another moment longer, both he and Delekhan would be dead and an 
unspeakable evil would be loose on our world. When Delekhan began to 
change you could see the valheru were attempting to mold them into a 
form they could use. Do you remember the terrible devastation we saw on 
Timirianya? That would be a paradise compared to the lives we would 
lead under their dominion. I'm telling you this because you now have 
knowledge and abilities which come with terrible responsibilities. You 
will have to make decisions far worse than this someday if you continue 
down the path you are on. You are going to have to learn to think 
before you act, but never to regret your decisions, right or wrong. 
Otherwise, you will slowly begin to not make decisions at all."<p>

"But how can I know which are the right decisions?" Owyn asked. "How 
can I be sure?"<p>

Pug squeezed his shoulder. "You need to live to a ripe old age to know 
that and I am not nearly old enough to have an answer. All I know is 
what Macros the Black once told me. He said to train those around me 
well, to make them powerful, but also to make them loving and generous. 
I see those things in you."<p>

The battle was against them.<p>

Enraged, Warleader Moraeulf growled orders to his terror stricken 
lieutenants as he reviewed their weakening lines from the safety of an 
elm shaded hill, watched with fury as his forward ranks of pikemen 
retreated under an unexpectedly heavy rain of Kingdom longbow fire. In 
a short while, the combined mass of Prince Arutha's relief forces and 
the garrison at Sethanon would be in a position to push them into the 
only quarter of the city where they would be unable to retreat, and 
then it would only be a matter of hours before they would be forced to 
surrender or die in a blaze set to flush them out.<p>

"Warleader Moraeulf, you must come quickly!" Hearing a commotion to 
his left, he muttered a silent curse on Delekhan's head for leading them 
on this fool's errand, then snapped his attention to a small group of 
moredhel who were advancing towards him, faces flushed with excitement. 
Their leader, a scar faced whelp of twenty summers, knelt reverently at 
his feet before breathlessly delivering his message. "At the Keep! Your 
father has taken Prince Arutha! And I believe the marked one is with 
him! The tide of the battle turns!"<p>

Stalking skeptically after his messengers, he progressed through a 
ruined avenue and into a cobbled central square filled with conversing 
moredhel warriors. Above them, Delekhan mounted the fire blackened 
parapet walk of the keep, preceded by a mysterious robed figure and the 
Prince of Krondor, the later bound hand and foot, unable to do anything 
but follow where he was lead.<p>

"Brethren!" Silence fell over the square as the robe clad figure 
stepped past Arutha and Delekhan and into an archer's turret, a hand 
placed over his right breast. Ripping open his white garment, he 
revealed a body made gaunt with hunger, but bearing an unmistakable 
curling purple birth mark which resembled a dragon and was the mark of 
legend. Instantly, a chant rose among the moredhel warriors, many of 
them falling to their knees in ecstatic reverence.<p>

"I have returned, O my children!" Murmandamus shouted from the 
battlements, revealing a glittering sword of gold, its hilt set with 
stones of lapis. "Hidden deep in the chambers of earth below our feet, 
Prince Arutha sought to keep this sword from me, from us, the key to 
our future! For ten years he imprisoned me in the bowels of this hell 
against my will, but you have freed me," he said, sweeping the air with 
the sword. "Ten years ago I promised you the dawning of a new age. I 
was repaid with abandonment. But today I am free, because you who 
followed Delekhan believed in our dream. You have demonstrated your 
worthiness and loyalty, and as a reward you shall all bear witness to 
the death of the Lord of the West and the final fulfillment of the 
Prophesy!"<p>

A dark cheer rippled through the crowd as Murmandamus held the sword 
aloft and faced Arutha, his lips curled back in a wicked smile as he 
advanced on the dazed prince. Considering the things that had been done 
to him, the crowd thought it likely their former leader would execute 
Arutha slowly, and they were ripe for the spectacle.<p>

Abruptly Murmandamus halted. Beneath him, the stones of the keep began 
to tremble, as if the entirety of the structure were being shaken by an 
invisible hand. His look of proud defiance suddenly turned to outrage.<p>

"What treachery is this?" Murmandamus screamed. "Who meddles with the 
Prophesy?"<p>

As if in answer, thunder pealed overhead, announcing the arrival of a 
great dragon and rider, the pair seemingly having formed from the very 
air itself. Floating down from dizzying heights, they descended to a 
point level with the keep's rooftops, the dragon's wings beating great 
gales of wind against the crowd.<p>

"The Prophesy is false, Murmandamus, as are you!" Pug shouted from the 
dragon's back. "You have betrayed the folk of the Kingdom and those of 
your own people for a lie! It is time for your terror to come to an 
end!"<p>

At Pug's command Arutha ducked, narrowly averting death as the dragon 
skimmed low overhead, lashing the battlements with its titanic whip-like
tail, hurling both Murmandamus and Delekhan, screaming like babes, 
into the horrified hordes who watched far below. Fanning away from the 
impact of the two, bystanders hastened to escape, fearing a possible 
second attack from the flying dragon and its equally menacing rider.<p>

Standing in the midst of the crowd, Moraeulf looked on, void of pain or 
fear, his voice calm and clear as he addressed a goblin lieutenant who 
stood near him. "Gather your kin and call the retreat."<p>

"Lord Moraeulf, we may still win! Lead us!"<p>

Collaring the green skinned creature, Moraeulf lifted him off his feet. 
"I now lead the Nations of the North and my first command is that I 
shall lead us home."<p>

"Call the retreat," Moraeulf spat, hurling the goblin backwards. "The 
day is theirs, but I must see to something first."<p>

Disregarding the panicked warriors who sought egress from the square, 
Moraeulf picked his way over the burning rubble to where his father lay 
dead, his wolfish eyes reflecting only the clouds of smoke which 
drifted through Sethanon. For all his father's grand schemes, for all 
the things he had thought to accomplish, he was nothing now, nothing 
but a hulk of dead flesh. He had been a fool to trust the Tsurani 
magician.<p>

Leaning over the dead body, Moraeulf snatched up the golden sword which 
Murmandamus had retrieved from the caverns below. Although he knew very 
little of the Prophesy which had inspired both his father and 
Murmandamus to their deaths, he had no intention of wasting what little 
they had gained in the battle. Perhaps when he returned to the 
Northlands he could still find a way to harness the power of the 
artifact, assuming it had any powers at all...<p>

"Moraeulf!"<p>

Turning, the moredhel Warleader had no time to react before the 
lightning-quick assassin was upon him, driving a knife skillfully 
through his left eye and deep into his brain, killing him instantly. 
Without a sound, he crumpled to the ground across his dead father, 
dropping the sword even before he could raise it.<p>

Smiling coldly, Narab withdrew his knife and wiped clean the grey flesh 
from its bone blade, then snatched Murmandamus' prized sword from where 
it lay abandoned on the ground. One by one he had borne witness to the 
destruction of his rivals; Gorath of the Ardanien, his own brother 
Nago, Delekhan and his son Moraeulf, all destroyed by their own greed 
or inaction. Now there would be the matter of dealing with the bitch 
Liallan who had been Delekhan's mate, and then he might even claim the 
throne of Sar-Sargoth for himself, assuming no bastard get of the 
former warleader claimed the right. It would be of small consequence, 
however, for now he possessed what they had all sought. Assuming he 
lived, he would learn to exploit his new found advantage.<p>

Resheathing his knife in his boot, he spotted a slow moving band of 
moredhel limping towards the Dimwood, and he hurried to join them, 
blending in with the crowd in the same manner in which he had come to 
Sethanon, as an unrecognizable face in a mob of the beaten and the 
angry.<p>

Arutha watched with mild wonder as Pug conjured the Prince's duplicate 
into nonexistence, then just as quickly eliminated the remarkably life-like
illusions of Delekhan and Murmandamus who lay crumpled on the 
ground below the Keep. The corpse of Delekhan's son would have to be 
removed later by less arcane means.<p>

"A shame we didn't have you with us at Armengar, cousin Pug," Arutha 
said. "A performance such as that before Murmandamus' troops might have 
won us the battle."<p>

Pug shook his head. "Spectacle won't win your battles, but at least it 
may prevent the Dark Brothers from plotting another attack against 
Sethanon. With the dozen or more moredhel witnesses you've left alive 
on the battlefield, most of them should return alive to the Northlands. 
Having seen their leaders die and possessing the object Murmandamus 
sought, they'll have little reason to return here."<p>

"Let us hope," Arutha said. I have little desire to do this again."<p>

"What about the artifact?" Owyn asked.<p>

"A useless sword," Pug replied with a grin. "The Oracle of Aal 
indicated a hidden room where I might find it when I asked for 
assistance with the plan. Shortly after that moredhel gentleman who 
picked it up returns to Sar-Sargoth, he will discover it useless and 
curse the names of both of them for having spilled so much moredhel 
blood on false prophesies."<p>

Seeing James and Locklear poking about in the ruins near the keep, 
Arutha scowled. "I have a feeling those two are going to keep me busy 
for months with their questions about this place. Fortunately they're 
loyal - if I tell them the subject is closed, they'll both trust me 
enough to leave the issue alone."<p>

"You can always tell them the sword was truly what was buried here," 
Owyn suggested. "The answer is good enough for the moredhel."<p>

Arutha shook his head. "Locklear will probably forget the matter once 
he sees a pretty young face in Krondor, but Jimmy is different. He 
won't accept it, though he will never ask anything more. I don't like 
that I will have to lie to him. He's as loyal a subject as I've ever 
had."<p>

"What about the Tsurani?" Owyn asked. Nodding, Arutha seemed equally 
concerned with Pug's answer.<p>

"I shall have to talk with them. A well-respected member of the 
Assembly of Magicians named Hochopeppa already knows something of the 
event and he will help me assuage their fears," Pug said. "Thankfully 
they have their hands tied with another bothersome individual at the 
moment."<p>

Satisfied, Arutha said his farewells and moved off to be of assistance 
in evacuating the remaining soldiers from the area, fearing that some 
might become too curious and discover things best left unfound. While 
watching the Prince depart, Pug smiled quietly to himself, gaining 
Owyn's attention.<p>

"You seem pleased about something," Owyn said." What is it?"<p>

"You will note that the Prince said nothing about your silence," Pug 
said. "You know the secret of Sethanon. In all of Midkemia, only Prince 
Arutha, King Lyam, Duke Martin, Tomas of Elvandar and myself truly know 
what lies beneath our feet." As if to reinforce the point, Pug tapped 
his staff at Owyn's feet.<p>

"What are you saying?"<p>

Smiling, Pug began to lead him down the winding path towards the city's 
smashed southern gate. "What that means is the Prince expects me to 
guarantee your silence. That will be difficult to do. With you in 
Tiburn and me at my Academy of Magicians at Stardock, it will require 
that I make a number of long and tiresome journeys for the sole purpose 
of ensuring you keep your silence. It seems a waste of time." Stopping 
to look into the sunset, Pug seemed lost in thought. "Of course, it is 
possible I could take you on as a student of magic, your living 
expenses paid in full by Prince Arutha. Are you interested in becoming 
a true magician, Owyn?"<p>

Laughing for the first time in a great while, Owyn twirled his staff in 
his hands. "I've never wanted anything else..."<p>
