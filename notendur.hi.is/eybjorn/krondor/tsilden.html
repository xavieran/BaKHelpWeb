Soaked for ages in the rank perfume of fish scales and sea salt, the wharves of 
Silden seemed more likely a home for a race of fish men than the leather skinned 
sailors who trod its wooden planked docks. Traditionally the home of the less 
reputable, it was known for its shady transactions with the slavers of Greater 
Kesh.

Owyn surveyed the shop. Though he could see no perceptible evidence the shop's owner
had placed any special wards around his inventory, he was dimly aware of something 
unnatural about the doorway through which they had passed. In the pit of his stomach, 
he knew that thieves would find themselves the victim of some magical unpleasantness.

The man scarcely acknowledged them.<p>
"You look a sorry dog," Locklear commented, noting the long look on the man's face. 
"What troubles you?"<p>
"Today I drink up the last winnings I ever made in lancers' tourneys," he said, 
watching the swirling contents of his cup. "From this day forth, I have to earn 
an unsullied day's living."<p>
Locklear arched a brow. "I wouldn't call being a lancer a sullied profession."<p>
"No," the man replied with a pained smile. "Not ordinarily. But I am beginning 
to advance in years and my strength is not all it used to be. At the last 
lancer's tourney, I bought a vial of Fadamor's Formula. Unfortunately, before 
the last joust of the day, I was discovered drinking it. My lord rescinded my 
bond and the master of ceremonies forbid me ever attending an other tourney so I 
may never again seek another noble employer." Reaching into his belt, he pulled 
out a small vial and slapped it into Locklear's palm. "All yours. I’ll be happy not to 
see another drop of it in all my life."<p>
Locklear squinted. "Why give this to us?"<p>
"I'm not specifically giving it to you," the man said. "You were just at hand 
when I decided to give it up. But to give you an understanding why I'm giving it 
up, perhaps I should show you something." Pulling up the hem of his tunic, he 
indicated a puckered scar which marred the flesh above his navel. "Several of 
the knights I defeated in the tourney gathered together and among them decided I 
should be taught a lesson. A hot iron shoved in to your guts can be a very 
convincing teacher."

The man grumbled.<p>

Not sure whether the comment was an invitation or an indication they should leave, James
approached the man cautiously. "Good day."<p>

"Good day my arse. Damn madness, all this guild feuding," he spat, wiping ale from his lips
with the back of his hand. "I had a regular job before all this madness began up in Romney.
Now I have to do my job under the cover of night. If Arlie Steelsoul would come to the
negotiations table with the rest of the Guilds, we could bring this idiocy to a halt!"<p>

"Has anyone talked to him?" James asked.<p>

"Who can?" the man replied. "He's got himself sealed up in his house near Sloop. None of the
Duke of Romney's men have been able to get through to him. He won't even allow his supplies to
be delivered to his door anymore, has them dropped off in a box. Serve him right if someone sent
in a pack of rations that had been sitting in the sun a month or more, arrogant bastard. Know
how much it costs me to harbor my flats now? 100 sovereigns every two weeks!"<p>

Despite James's repeated attempts to steer the conversation in a more interesting direction, the
man insisted in relating his docking fees at the various points along the river and the
outrageous lengths to which he had to resort to deliver his goods unmolested. At last, the
effect of his ale beginning to overwhelm him, he slumped against the wall and began to snore.

<blockquote>

James paused.<p> 
Though he had thought to get the man's attention, he decided he was far more 
interested what the man was whispering to a mercenary who was seated nearby.<p>
"<i>...well, who 'as the Crawlers key then?</i>"<p> 
The man shrugged. "<i>Kivo dropped it in the scramble out the sewers. After they 
did in the Upright Man, none of us had the desire to stick about any longer. 
Mockers were right mad...</i>"<p>
"<i>So, it's still in the sewers, is it?</i>"<p>
"<i>Unless one of the Mocker's boys picked it up, I'd say so, yes. Not like it 
matters, what with the Crawler crawled away to the Sunset Isles...</i>"<p>
Disturbed, James slipped away from the conversation. Though it was possible the 
men were bandying about things overheard from a rumor monger, the demise of the 
Upright Man in Krondor would have far reaching implications both for the Kingdom 
and for himself.

James tried the lock.<p>

He moved closer to examine the brass plated lock, but a group of 
sailors wandering by made him wary. "No sense risking a night in the

Gorath watched the docks.<p>

Behind him, James stood with his ear pressed against the door of the 
house, listened for the stirring of the Crawler or his men, but heard 
only the thumping of his own heart. The door was locked and as he 
reached inside his pack to search for his keys and picklocks, he saw a 
very small, very straight crack in the trim beside the door. Smiling at 
the old Mockers trick, he pressed his thumb against the trim and pushed 
down. The wood slid away, revealing a small brass key! Removing it from 
its hiding place, he jammed it into the brass lock, whispering his 
thanks to the old Mocker who had first taught him the trick. Within, 
the house was dim, but not so dark that James couldn't navigate by 
instinct alone. Creeping, he investigated the whole of the three room 
house, noting anything that looked out of the ordinary. Near the 
fireplace he discovered something that appeared to be a chest, but 
dismissed it as suspect, its location tagging it as a trap for less 
clever thieves.<p>

On the far wall, he eyed a row of five colorfully lacquered pots, each 
spilling over with a tangle of violet colored tondill horns. Many times 
in Krondor, he had heard the Princess Anita lamenting over the fact the 
flowers were nearly impossible to grow in the salty soil of the coastal 
regions and required nearly constant sunlight. Located as they were at 
the rear of the house, however, they would undoubtedly receive very 
little light at all. Smiling, he upturned each of the pots until, at 
last, he discovered the hidden powder bag and made a mental note to 
thank the princess for her relentless efforts to civilize him.<p>

Clutching his find triumphantly, he hurried outside to rejoin his very 
nervous looking travelling companions. Jimmy the Hand was still alive 
and well.<p>

do."

to get the Mist Devil ready for sailing out within the week. Is one of you 
critical ill?"<p>

"The Mist Devil, this is," the sailor replied proudly, pounding the railing with 
a fist. "Only ship fast enough to have slipped away from Captain Trenchard! 
We're readying sail for the Isle of Eortis at the moment."<p>
Locklear considered for a moment. How much for passage to the Isle?"<p>
