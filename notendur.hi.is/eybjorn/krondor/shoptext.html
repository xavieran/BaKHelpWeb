Locklear checked their funds.<p>
Although the values had fluctuated in the past five years due to trading

been ten silver royals to each golden sovereign. A favorable exchange rate, 
assuming of course they had some of either type of coin.<p>
After thoroughly searching all their possession, he discovered they had
[X] sovereigns.
