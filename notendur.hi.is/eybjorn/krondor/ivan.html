<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
We found the strangest thing earlier. It was this statue of a dragon out in the middle of 
nowhere. It was just standing in this little culvert with nothing around it.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>IVAN:</font>
Found old Malac's kill, did you? He wasn't always in the middle of nowhere. One time, he was 
just a hop, skip and a jump from the main row of Malac's Cross, but when the town moved, they 
left poor old Malac to fend for his own...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Why did they leave him behind?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>IVAN:</font>
The only man that ever thought Malac was a hero was Malac. Low born folk out and out hated him. 
Anyway, when the town began to fall under new raids by Keshian raiders come up from the Sea of 
Dreams, they decided to move the center of the town inside the see of the Abbaye Ishap. Raiders 
wouldn't touch the town after that, seeing as how the brothers of Ishap first came from Kesh. 
Later, after things had settled down a bit, they decided to leave the statue out there and let 
nature take it back. Strange thing about it, folks what have visited it recently have said a 
number of strange things about it...said it was talking to them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Sorry, but you've piqued my curiosity, what is an <i>en passah</i>? I've seen quite a few 
variations of chess but I don't think I've ever heard of that move.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>IVAN:</font>
It's Keshian. One night I was playing this fellow from Durbin. I had my game swinging on one 
particular pawn and the game was in my favor. So what does he do but move his pawn to the square
directly behind mine, then claim to have captured my piece!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
That's an illegal move.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>IVAN:</font>
So, I said. He goes on to tell me it's one of the most fundamental moves of the game. We argued 
about it for three hours until a student ran from the Queen's Row to the Abbaye to dig up an 
old book. And there it was. Back of the text, written in Keshian, the original rules to the
game. <i>En passah</i> cost me two diamonds and very nearly the Queen's Row itself. Needless to 
say, I don't allow that rule to be played in here anymore. Last fellow that tried to use it on 
me was a fellow named Navon Du Sandau and I set him straight, though he showed me an incredible 
move he invented called Sandau's Retreat. Can't quite remember how it worked now, though.<p>

The game was short.<p>

Lifting a confident hand to move his priest, Ivan tipped over Locklear's black queen. "Checkmate.
In five moves if I recall." Stroking his chin, he subdued an arrogant grin. "I warned you I was 
good. I believe you have an emerald of mine?"<p>

Ivan gaped in horror.<p>

On the chessboard, his well organized attack had decayed into a jumble of disorganized chaos 
while Locklear had somehow turned a tactical retreat into an outright offensive. Checkmate was 
inevitable.<p>

"Surrender?" Locklear asked, his hand poised on a hunter piece. "Or shall we continue?"<p>

Match? What kind of match?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>IVAN:</font>
You're in the Queen's Row and you can ask that question? A chess match of course. It was 
wondrous. Jamie Tiller was defending his title against that snot nosed prat from the Abbaye, 
Kyle Fischer. Jamie opened, moved his queen's pawn to fourth rank. Fischer opened with 
Abbar's Gambit - arrogant cud - but Jamie actually maneuvered into it with his knight. I was 
thinking that he was going for the queen...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
...But he sacrificed his King's rook and took the priest... It's a brilliant move, but it left 
his own queen vulnerable didn't it?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>IVAN:</font>
You've got a good head for the game, Seigneur.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
The Prince likes to play, but we don't always have a board handy. Once you learn to play in 
your head, a board almost becomes redundant. I have to admit it's tougher earlier into the game.
More pieces to keep track of.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>IVAN:</font>
It's still fun to watch, though. That's why the Queen's Row is here. Perhaps I can relates the 
rest of the game over ale, assuming you gents are buying. What can I get you today?<p>

Good enough... He's been running some sort of errand, though he hasn't told me what it was about
or who hired him. He said if he should drop out of sight for any length of time, he would be 
hiding in Darkmoor, probably in the common storage bins there. If you get near there, call out 
that Ivan has sent you. He'll make an appearance. I'll warn you though, trouble of ten follows

Drumming his fingers nervously on the bartop, James tried to find a way out of his current trap 
but his chances didn't look good. At best, the rest of his game would be defensive unless the 
barkeep made a critically bad move and that in no way seemed likely.<p>

While pounding James's leftward defensive positions, Ivan

priest and his queen.<p>

Ivan grinned as he tossed a pawn from the board. "Seems I'm inside
your line. Ready to surrender yet?"<p>

"Not exactly," James replied, sliding his hunter piece to
the opposite side of the board. "Have you ever heard of Abbar's Turn?"<p>

Abruptly the barkeep's face went pale as he studied the pieces. "You couldn't. You did." For 
the next three moves he made feeble attempts to regain the strength of his position but at last
gave it up as vain hope. "I surrender."<p>

James motioned to the figure across the room.<p>

The man walked over to join them. He stood before them, eyebrows arched inquisitively.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>IVAN:</font>
Tell me something. What is it that Malac's Cross has done to deserve the Abbaye Ishap? Have we 
done some grievous deed to the King that he should ditch a wagon load of disrespectful, annoying,
self-centered little dung haulers into our midst? What is it now?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I take it the students from the Abbaye Ishap are causing you grief.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>IVAN:</font>
No. The neighbor's dog digging up your begonias and piddling on your front step, that is grief. 
No, what the Abbaye and her blessed students have given me is a twinging ulcer and a head full 
of grey hair!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
That's strange. I would think that students would be excellent customers.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>IVAN:</font>
Oh well now, customers, yes. I can't stock ale fast enough to keep their eyeballs floating, but 
as someone that has to babysit their noble asses...that is another matter. I say lock the sorry 
prats in the basement until they'ze twenty or thereabouts.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Are you sure that you haven't been speaking to the Prince? Sounds like something that he would 
say about his twins. Borric and Erland may be princes of the blood royal, but in Arutha's eyes 
they are nothing but a royal pain in the behind.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>IVAN:</font>
Kids are all the same, whether their blood's blue or not. What can I get for you today?<p>

The man walked over to join them. He stood before them, eyebrows arched inquisitively.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>IVAN:</font>
Brave customers tonight! And I thought I was going to tend the hearth with these puny lads.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
How have we merited bravery, barkeep?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>IVAN:</font>
Haven't you heard the stories? Why there's snake people about, roaming the streets stealing 
babes from their mother's arms and giving sheep the blue heaves. Stole the gambols right off 
old nursemaid Finch's house and plugged up the gutters at the Abbaye Ishap.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
You don't seem to have had any difficulties.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>IVAN:</font>
Ah, no. I wouldn't! I lives here and don't have to tread the roads. Can't just close up shop 
when some pratting student elects to rumble the locals.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
So you think this is all part of a prank?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>IVAN:</font>
Come off it, lad! Snakes that looks like people and runnin about stealing chickens? If it's not 
a joke then I'm a gwali's uncle! Course it's a prank! What 'ja take me for, an old buggering 
gaffer? Now, what can I do for you two?<p>

Do you know an old woman who goes by the name Petrumh?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>IVAN:</font>
She comes in and drinks on occasion. You looking for her?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Actually, no. We ran into her and she said she left something behind the last time she was in 
here. She asked us to pick it up for her.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>IVAN:</font>
I'll say she left something behind. Keg of Keshian Ale. Good thing I didn't drain it myself.
I'll get it for you before you leave.<p>
