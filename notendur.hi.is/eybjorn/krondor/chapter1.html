THE CHAPTER BEGINS<p>
</font>
</center>

<blockquote>

One by one he tended the wincing soldier's purple wounds, stitched, 
salved, bandaged, did what little he could in the leaping golden halo 
of firelight. Fortunately for his roadside patient, he could do more 
than most.<p>

Fingers slick with alum ointment, he worked fervently to tie off a 
catgut cord, then brushed the injury with a light touch that to the 
untrained eye would seem only a friendly pat - others would recognize 
the telltale hand gesture as a magical ward against infection.<p>

"Done," Owyn sighed, wiping his hand in a rust colored cloth. "No 
guarantees, though. The stitches may hold all the way to LaMut and then 
again, push too hard and you could be bleeding like a stuck pig on 
Midsummers".<p>

"You did - fine," Seigneur Locklear replied, smiling 
approval before rolling down his sleeve. "It'll scar but it's good for 
a noble's reputation. Lets the kingdom folk know he isn't resting on 
his laurels and it impresses the ladies. I'll be sure to look you up in 
Tiburn if ever I need stitching up again."<p>

The boy accepted the compliment with a humble nod while he packaged 
away the rest of his medical supplies, his thoughts focused instead on 
a third man who slumped in the shadows across from them. Despite the 
manacles that bound the stranger's hands and the distance that 
separated them, the boy felt dreadfully exposed, his avenues of escape 
limited should Locklear's elven-looking prisoner decide to liberate 
himself.<p>

"What did he do?" Owyn whispered, jerking his head towards the man.<p>

"Gorath? Let's just say that he had the disadvantage of being at the 
wrong place at the wrong time," Locklear said cautiously. He snatched a 
greenish apple out of his knapsack, offering one to Owyn. "I have to 
take him to Krondor."<p>

"Did he kill someone?" Owyn asked.<p>

"No."<p>

"He attacked you."<p>

The Seigneur wiped apple juice from his mouth, shook his head. "No, no, 
not exactly."<p>

"Well, who cut you up then?"<p>

Before Locklear could reply...<p>

...Gorath leapt forward, his chains writhing between his wrists like metallic vipers.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Get out from underfoot, Owyn! Assassin in the camp!<p> 
<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Do not struggle so, Haseth. I wish to keep you alive.<p>
<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
But be glad I do not. The goddess of death will show you greater mercy.<p>

LEAVING HASETH'S BODY</font><p>
</center>

<blockquote>

Gorath seemed distant.<p>
Though the moredhel warrior didn't appear grieved about killing the assassin 
that had followed them from the Northlands, his eyes had a baleful look in them 
that seemed something between hatred and rage. Several times he glanced back at 
the corpse that lay behind them in the dust, his thoughts unguessable from his 
expression.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Do you wish to bury him? We could do that.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
It is not our way. I simply am somewhat disturbed that he should come after 
me. He was...a kinsman. There are other things that trouble me as well.
Delekhan's assistants are slow but not altogether stupid. Another like Haseth 
and you'll only have my corpse to drag before your Prince Arutha.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Sorry, you don't get off that easy. As long as you are under my command you 
are forbidden to die, moredhel. I've gone to far too much trouble keeping 
you alive to bury you now.
Its time that we took the chains off of you. It'll be far easier for you to 
defend yourself if your hands are free to swing a sword again.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
You're not just going to set him free are you? I thought you said he was 
your prisoner.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
He is my prisoner, Owyn, but the circumstances are terribly complicated. 
Even if he chose to sneak off, he'd be lucky to make it to the next town alive. 
This is the third such assassin we've run into since we left the Northlands and 
I have a feeling that more will be waiting for us. He will be much safer with me 
and I with him.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
As the boy would be. If he were to whisper the wrong word in the wrong ear, 
he could easily be the death of us.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Me? Who am I going to talk to? I'm not even heading in the same direction.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
It wouldn't be a matter of who you talked to, Owyn. There will be ears 
listening for word of a moredhel travelling with a noble. Damnation. I should 
have thought about this when you entered camp.
For the time being, you're my squire. Once we arrive safely at the palace, 
you’ll be free to go your own way.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
But I have pressing business in Tiburn.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
This is not a subject of debate! We must get to Krondor. My mission is of 
critical importance and I don't have time to improvise an easy solution. The 
only other possible option would be to slit your throat and leave you dying. I 
have absolutely no desire to do that. Now let's get moving before Delekhan's 
assassins catch our scent again. They'll likely come looking when Haseth doesn't 
return from his mission.<p>

EXITING TRAP SOUTH OF ZUN</font><p>
</center>

<blockquote>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
<i>This</i> took some time for them to assemble.
I thought perhaps the assassins that had attacked us thus far had followed us 
through the Inclindel, but there are too many of them, even to chase a renegade 
like Gorath. Delekhan has to be calling on spies already placed within the 
Kingdom.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
But Delekhan sits in Sar-Sargoth. Word of my escape could only have travelled as 
we have come...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
The fact that we have been attacked this far south suggests otherwise...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
I have never been a witness to it, but I have heard of a talent called mind 
speech. Very few magicians have it, but the ability allows men to communicate 
over very long distances. Perhaps Delekhan might have hired such help.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
It is entirely possible. Even before I escaped from his fortress, it was rumored 
that the magicians with whom he has been keeping company had such talents. I 
know that his assistant Nago claimed to have such powers, though I never saw 
evidence of such.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
And if Delekhan has the capacity, then undoubtedly he shall use his assistants. 
So we will have to be cautious and watch out for any who seem like magicians as 
we head for Krondor. Both of you, keep your eyes open...<p>

</blockquote>

<font size=+2>
HEADING EAST FROM HIGHCASTLE</font><p>
</center>

<blockquote>


Locklear fretted.<p>

Miles away from the objective he knew they should be pursuing, he managed to assuage his nagging
concerns by noting the fact that there had been far fewer assassins in their way since they had 
taken the diversionary route away from Krondor. Inevitably, they would of course head to the 
Prince, but in his gut he knew none of the assassins would have suspected them to head into the 
hills south of Highcastle...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
We've probably come far enough east to have thrown any other assassins off the track. You have 
a better idea of what Delekhan would throw at us, Gorath. What do you think?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
I think that if I were he, I would hunt us in the same way that one hounds a fox. You chase him 
and snap at his heels, all the while driving him out of fear into his hole.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
And in this instance, the hole is Krondor. If he doesn't already suspect our destination, he 
can't stay unaware of it too long. But he couldn't lay his trap for us in Krondor itself. Even 
a large contingent of elves there is enough to stir up a ruckus.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
I suspect a trap immediately to the north of our objective. That would be most prudent.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
I think I'd have to agree. Slipping in at night from the southeast would probably be the best 
way in... I'll at least keep it in mind as we travel.

MEETING JAMES IN THE SEWERS</font><p>
</center>

<blockquote>

Someone whistled.<p>

Turning round, Locklear felt a stone sink in his gullet, fearing that they had left themselves 
open to attack by yet another band of Nighthawks. To his great surprise, however, a familiar 
friend stepped from the shadows.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
By the twelve gods Locklear, your hair!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
It's just like you Jimmy. I haven't seen you in seven months, then I rescue you from a band of 
Nighthawks and the first thing you want to talk about is my bloody change of hair color! What is
going on around here? The front gate is smashed and there are Nighthawks loose in the sewers.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Not Nighthawks. Impostors. Someone has been trying to convince Prince Arutha that the Guild of 
Death has reestablished operations here in Krondor and is using the sewers as their hideout, 
hoping that the Lancers will come down and clean out the place. In doing so, I think whoever is 
running this game hopes that the Lancers will root out the Mockers while they are at it. <p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
What, take out the Guild of Thieves? Doesn't seem likely from all the things you've told me 
from your days as a Mocker.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
More to the point, we know now a few of the Nighthawks escaped to Romney when we smashed them 
up after that affair with Princess Anita. They certainly won't dare tread Krondor's streets for 
a while yet. I'd been tracking around down here trying to find out more when I ran into those 
fellows... So...why have you come back so soon to Krondor, Locky? I thought you were going to be
gone another four months or so.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
I've got bad news from the Northlands. Looks like the Dark Brothers are stirring again. They 
raised Murmandamus' battle standards over Sar-Sargoth and there's a moredhel army gathering to 
attack the Kingdom. This moredhel used to be one of their clan chieftains, something of a hero 
during the Riftwar against the Tsurani too. I thought Prince Arutha would be interested in 
talking to him.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I don't like this, Locky. The moredhel stirring again in the north and someone mimicking the 
Guild of Death... My bump of trouble says that things are going to get far worse before they get
better... I assume since you're down here that you're trying to get into the palace the way I 
showed you a few years ago?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Yes...I was thinking I would have to pry off the grate somehow, but if you have the key, it 
would save me a great deal of trouble.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Still on me. It's all yours. I can find my own way into the palace. I'm going to creep around a
while longer down here and see if I can unravel this particular mystery.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Suit yourself. I, for one, am anxious to get out of this hole. Come and get me for breakfast 
tomorrow after I've spoken to Prince Arutha!<p>

THE CHAPTER ENDS</font><br>
<font size=+1>Entering Krondor Palace</font><p>
</center>

<blockquote>

The gate swung open.<p>

Revolted by the thick scent of excrement in the chamber, Locklear 
hastened to the ladder affixed on the far wall and ascended its filth 
slick rungs. Behind him, Gorath and Owyn reluctantly did likewise, 
gaffing on the noxious vapors in the shaft.<p>

"This is nothing," Locklear grunted, shoving upwards against a 
grating. "All the windows in the palace are open right now. You ought 
to smell it in the winter."<p>

Darkness surrounded them as they slithered out of the privy, their only 
impressions of the chamber provided by the faint flicker of distant 
firelight. Ten yards before them the hall joined with an elaborate 
colonnade stretching in either direction.<p>

"Somehow I hadn't pictured my first visit to Krondor like this," Owyn 
sighed, falling blindly into step behind Gorath and the Seigneur.<p>

"What, you didn't like the romantic tour?" Locklear chuckled. "Not many 
people get to see that way into the palace."<p>

Drawing up short, Locklear's features brightened as he observed a pair 
of approaching figures lost in conversation. Self-conscious of his 
bedraggled condition he straightened his uniform and cleared his throat 
with a stentorian air:<p>

"Greetings Prince Arutha and Master Magician Pug!"<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
As glad as I am at the sight of you safely home again, Locklear, I 
can't say that my nose is as well pleased. I thought we had broken you 
and Seigneur James of clambering round in the sewers.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
You know the way of old habits, highness. We encountered a bit of 
trouble with the gates and so I chose a more expedient though somewhat 
more disagreeable path. It came to a happy end, however. James told us 
to send word that he is well and would see you in the morning.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
Incurable sewer rats, the both of you. I shall have to order that each 
of you be accompanied by a score of washing maidens to keep you 
presentable enough for court. Welcome home, Locky.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Thank you. As happy as I am to be here, I'm afraid I come with bad news 
from the Northlands.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
I expected as much. With the false Nighthawks prowling my streets above 
and below it can only mean the moredhel are up to their old mischief. 
What do you know?<p>

Motioning to Gorath, Locklear introduced the former moredhel chieftain 
with a wave. Slowly, Gorath lowered his hood. The gasps and startled 
reactions of those crowding the hall helped mask the stealthy entrance 
of a second moredhel in the chamber; this one armed with a longbow!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
Assassin! Get Down!<p>
