<blockquote><blockquote><font size=+1>
If not for the crude diagrams which accompanied the text, most of the book
would have been largely incomprehensible, the majority of the words misspelled,
inaccurate, or so obscure that [James] had never heard of them. Despite the book's
shortcomings, he was able to learn quite a bit about the basic repair and
maintenance of weapons and armor. In a crude addendum. there was also a
hastily scrawled list with useful information:<p>
<i><b>
It has ben fount that certane substinsayes can be appleyed to rmur to
countervoid the effects of poyzins used by an oponunt. In the folowin list,
the first itum of a pare can be uzed on rmur two counter uffects of the secund item
of the pare.<p>
<ul>
<li>Silvurthoarn Aunty-Dote and Silvurthoarn Poizun
<li>Sariksbane and Silvur Spider Poizun
<li>Flame Rut and Naptha ignightud blade
<li>Dragun Stone and Steal fired enchanted blade
<li>Sariksbane and Frostud Blade (I think maid by Althifain's Icer?)
<li>Clearikal Oilcloth and Clearikal Oilcloth
<li>Kiliun's Rut Oil and Kiliun's Rut Oil
</ul></b></i><p>
