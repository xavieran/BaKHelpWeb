James spotted a man in a field.<p>

Bent over, he appeared to be a farmer of some stripe, though his work seemed to become more 
industrious as they drew closer to him. Undoubtedly, he had seen them as well.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Quite a nice little stead you have here...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAX:</font>
If you like busting sod, I suppose so. I've had a mind to sell a few times. Events here recently,
I'm liking things less and less. I may just sell everything out like I've been telling everybody
else. Course I wouldn't expect a kept boy like you to understand.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Probably wouldn't, but this seems like such a nice lot to give up. Why would you want to?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAX:</font>
Everybody knows that something evil happened at the Battle of Sethanon, definitely unnatural. 
Me myself, I used to live in the center of town before King Lyam offered up the money that I 
should leave. I didn't think much of leaving, but I thought that the evil would stay there.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
And it hasn't? It's creeping down the road from Sethanon?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAX:</font>
Listen boy, I don't care for your attitude. You may be all educated, but it don't mean you know 
nothing about the world. If you're wise, you'll stay away from Sethanon and take anybody else 
that'll go with you. There's something evil here abouts and I don't want to be about when at 
last it gets here...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
So, how much do you want for your land?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAX:</font>
I...uh...what?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
If this evil is so imminent and you're anxious to be away from it, I'd be interested in buying 
this little lot of yours. I'm not afraid of ghosts. What will you sell it to me for?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAX:</font>
Well I haven't actually decided to make the move as yet... Don't want to get the cart before the
horse you know... It'll likely be a while before I sell, see... Don't want to rush it...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Do you know anything about the land that adjoins yours by any chance? Is it for sale?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAX:</font>
Uh, no. Not anymore. I bought it when old widow Petrumh moved out.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Bought it? I thought you said you wished to move?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAX:</font>
I do and... Look, I haven't time to stand about talking all day. If you're interested in the 
land go ahead and look a round - just stay clear of my stead. Now, I got things to do. Good day.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Good day to you, sir.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Would you happen to know who lives in that house nearby?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAX:</font>
I should. I lived half me life in it. Name's Max Feeber.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Are you certain?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAX:</font>
Are you funny in the head, lad? Course I'm sure. How could I not be?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Do you often make it a habit to go digging in graveyards?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAX:</font>
What do you mean?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I mean, the three of us found a burial cloth and we think you have something to do with all 
this evil that is going on around here. You've been desecrating graves haven't you?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAX:</font>
You broke into my house! I'll tell the constable for this!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
If he were still living in town I might feel threatened, but I rather imagine you've already 
managed to scare him off. Now talk, or I'm going to have a cozy little chat with a friend of 
mine named Nivek - Prince Arutha's tax collector - nice fellow. I think the two of you will get 
along marvelously...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAX:</font>
One grave! One grave only, I dug up. I don't remember the fellow's name now, but he used to own 
the Six Toe Tavern before Nia took over the shop. I thought that maybe I could scare her into 
moving out and selling to me but she's too darn stubborn.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
What did you do with the corpse?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAX:</font>
No corpse about him! He was down to his skeleton. I tried to rebury him but I never found one 
of his hands. It's bound to be near the graveyard. I think I may have dropped it when I was near
old Hershel's house.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
What else?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAX:</font>
That's it. That's all I know! Honest. Dug him up and then I reburied him.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
We'll need to find that hand then and bury it. No thanks to you. Good bye sir and I would advise
that you stay away from the Six Toe Tavern from now on. I doubt you will be warmly greeted.<p>

Looking up at them suspiciously, the farmer pushed the sweat drenched hair out of his eyes with 
the back of his hand and waited, his eyes narrowed as they drew closer. He didn't seem pleased 
to have guests.<p>
