Welcome to the Six Toe Tavern. What can I do for you?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
What's a shop doing open out here? I thought everybody packed up and left when King Lyam helped 
the people evacuate Sethanon.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIA:</font>
Everybody didn't leave as you can see, and it's not been easy keeping up and all, not since my 
father died. But I don't really wish to talk about it at the moment. Would you like something 
to eat? I have some rations I just prepared and they're only seven gold a bundle. Please say 
you'll say yes. Shall I get some for you?<p>

Thank you but no. I think we're well enough disposed for supplies at the moment. Perhaps another

You'll come back. The Six Toe has the best prices in the area so I'm fairly certain I'll see you

would mean quite a bit to me.<p>

Certainly. Good day to you.<p>

James motioned to the figure across the room.<p>

The woman made her way across the wooden floor until she was standing before them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Hello there, may I buy...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIA:</font>
I can't open up the shop! I don't care how much you have to offer or who you are. I can't go in 
there again.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I was offering, miss, to buy you a drink...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIA:</font>
Oh...oh, sorry. I was thinking you were stopping in to buy something from my goods store across 
the road. Since my father's death I've had the run of these two places, the tavern here and the 
goods store across the way. You know, I've had folks in here, four a week by last count, all 
offering money for a sword made by a hermit up North. Fool that I am, I sent the word out, but 
that was before things started happening in my store. I've since closed up things for a bit.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Closed your store? Why? What sorts of things were going on in there?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIA:</font>
You'll think I'm foolish...<i>I</i> think I'm foolish...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Tell me and I'll listen. If I laugh once, even once, you may upend a cask of ale over my head.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIA:</font>
You'll pay for the cask if I do... All right then. I'll tell you. In the past few weeks, I've 
seen a man prowling about in my shop.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
That's easy enough. Between companions and myself, we can get rid of your prowler by dinnertime 
tomorrow.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIA:</font>
Can you now? You run through ghosts as easy as that, poleax poltergeists in your spare time?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Ghosts? This prowler of yours is a ghost?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIA:</font>
Told you that you wouldn't believe me. I'll put it to you though. If you can find a way to put 
the ghost in my shop to rest, then I'll reopen my shop and give you the Galon Griefmaker that I 
bought from the hermit. Simple as that.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
That offer is nearly as attractive as the woman delivering it. Thank you, fair lady.<p>

I don't know how you've done it, but bless you. I've not heard a knock or a bump coming from my 
shop for hours! First time in weeks! After I do a little dusting, I should be able to reopen it 
for business. And seeing that you've held up your end of the bargain, I'll hold up mine. As 
requested, you can have the Galon Griefmaker I told you about. Thank you again and please come 
by the shop across the street any time. I promise I'll give you the best bargains you'll find!<p>

I hope you haven't come by the tavern for a drink. Tapped out the last of my supplies this
morning and I don't know how long it'll be before the wagons come round again. No one wants to 
come anywhere close to Nia's Goods, even though its across the crossroad!<p>

We'll do what we can, good lady.<p>

Owyn motioned to the figure across the room.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIA:</font>
Welcome to the Six Toe Tavern and...oh, hello again! I haven't seen you since you came through 
last. You were headed towards Krondor, in quite a hurry as I recall...ah, Orel wasnt it? And
your elf friend here was Thorgath?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
What? Oh, yes...Thorgath, certainly, but my name is Owyn. We were passing back through and I 
thought we'd stop in for a rest or something to eat.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIA:</font>
If it's a rest you're after then you're more than welcome to have a seat, but all my food's been
requisitioned.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Requisitioned? By whom?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIA:</font>
By the Krondorian Lancers, or at least that's who the captain said they were. He said that the 
Prince requested that I turn over my provisions for them. They compensated me for my trouble of 
course, one thousand sovereigns.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Congratulations! Any plans for your newly found wealth?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIA:</font>
No, not really. I think I'll just concentrate on tidying up things around here, maybe find a 
dashing young seigneur or baronet who needs a rich mistress.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Where do I stand in line?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NIA:</font>
Sorry, but I already have someone in mind. What say I make it up to you with a bottle of port?
Obviously I couldn't let the soldiers take everything, so I kept a few bottles to sell until I 
restocked here. Why don't you take a look at the stock?<p>
