Gorath halted.<p>

Staring at Owyn intently, he waited for the boy to explain himself.<p>

"You tapped me on the shoulder. You wished to speak to me?" Gorath rumbled.<p>

"No," a voice answered behind them. "<i>I</i> did..."<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OBKHAR:</font>
I had at first thought myself deluded, but I see I am not. How is it that you are here? I heard 
that your head had been pitted on a stake outside Sar-Sargoth...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Not all who live in the Northlands bend to Delekhan's will. Providence would have it that he 
posted a guard outside my cell who was a close cousin and sympathetic to my situation. He bought
time for my escape.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OBKHAR:</font>
So your cousin's head now hangs in your stead... You have a grave responsibility on your 
shoulders.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
All the more reason to see an end to Delekhan's reign, Obkhar! He shall pay his blood for mine;
for each offense against my kin, I will redouble it against his flesh. I will allow him no 
quarter, give him no mercy, stay no blow against him for all he has done to our people. I should
think you would agree, Obkhar!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OBKHAR:</font>
On the graves of all he has slain, I swear that my cause is yours Gorath! However I may aid you,
you need only ask. But all this talk is fruitless. We must first escape this place or there shall 
be nothing left to avenge.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
I have been told by some who were taken captive here before that there is a river that runs 
underground and mixes with the Isbandi river...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OBKHAR:</font>
I have seen it with my own eyes, but the fumes that come from it may rob the strength from a man.<p>
On occasion I have seen some of Venutrier's men wearing masks made of bone and cloth... If we 
three had them, I believe we could make the escape.

Glancing up, the balding moredhel favored them with a blank look before staring back at the

James yelped.<p>

Rubbing his head where he had felt a hard thump, he turned and saw that Locklear and Patrus were
doing likewise. Exchanging puzzled looks, none were prepared for the sudden appearance of a 
towering moredhel.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OBKHAR:</font>
I too have difficulties. I am Obkhar. Perhaps it may be that we can help one another...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
You're assuming quite a bit. I don't think any of us have good reason to trust you, moredhel.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OBKHAR:</font>
Just now you all felt the pelt of my stones, each which hit your heads just as easily as would 
have a moredhel throwing knife. If I had wished you harm, you would already have been dead.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
You speak the Kingdom tongue remarkably well. Handy skill for a spy.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OBKHAR:</font>
We cannot trade our goods with the traders who come from the Kingdom or from far off places if 
we speak only our native tongue. It would seem it is beneath them to learn our language.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Granted. I'm still listening.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OBKHAR:</font>
There is a device which is being used by Delekhan to invade this wood. If it is left operational,
it will mean utter defeat for you. If Delekhan succeeds in his goal, he will use whatever it is 
hidden in Sethanon to gain the power that eluded Murmandamus' grasp. It will mean a new tyranny 
for your Kingdom and for mine.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
We already know about the device. Bled it out of one of the field captains that attacked
Northwarden. If you really mean to help us, tell us where to find the device.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OBKHAR:</font>
On a peninsula where the rivers meet. It is accessible only by passing through an illusion of a 
mountain created by the Six, though I am not sure from here where it is located. I have been 
looking for a magical artifact since I slipped out of the camp.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Artifact? For what purpose?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OBKHAR:</font>
Shortly after they began staging soldiers through the rift, I discovered the gate could be 
disrupted by something they called a Waani, a word foreign to me. I found such an item on a 
magician who was guarding the gate. Before I slew him, I discovered if thrown into the maelstrom
of the gate, it would cause it to collapse. I had thought it permanently destroyed...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Delekhan has a number of tricks up his sleeve. So, do you think we might be able to find another
of these devices?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OBKHAR:</font>
From what little I learned before I slew the magician, they are necessary in the creation of a 
gate. If one is to build a bridge, it is usually wise to bring more planks of wood than 
necessary in case one should snap.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Seems to be a reasonable assumption. Now it's just a matter of locating this...Waani? Who would 
have them?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OBKHAR:</font>
If any would know it would be the leader of the rearguard, Moraeulf. He has his troops preparing
themselves for the final advance near the southern tip of this wood...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Then I suppose it's time we went and had a talk with him.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Had a talk with him, Jimmy? Do you propose we simply walk up to him and ask for this device that
will destroy his campaign?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Not without saying hello first. We'll pose as Quegians and hope he doesn't see through us. In 
all this chaos, he can't possibly know everyone in all his companies.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OBKHAR:</font>
An admirable gamble. I approve...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Hear that, Locky? The moredhel approves. It must be a good idea. Let's get moving before I 
regain my common sense. Goodbye, Obkhar.<p>
