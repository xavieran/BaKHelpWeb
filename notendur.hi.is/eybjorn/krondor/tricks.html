<b>
<font color=#cccc00>
At the beginning of the game your characters are very poorly equipped,
and extremely poor. Be constantly on the lookout for better equipment,
more money & more food! Remember, that you can pick up Weapons & Armour that you don't
need for yourself, and try to sell them in the next Shop you come across. Make sure
you have a Whetstone, Armorer's Hammer, and Aventurine, and always repair Weapons
and Armor before selling, in order to get the best price. Before selling, make sure
that your Characters are equipped with the best.</font><p>

<font color=#00cccc>
Look out for any of the Basic Necessities. Restoratives and Herbal Packs are extremely 
useful in order to regain lost Health/Stamina points, and recover from a Condition. A
Shovel is needed in order to investigate Graveyards. Rope is needed in order to swing
over Pits in Dungeons.</font><p> 

<font color=#ff0000>
Although it is often a good idea to stick to the road, don't hesitate to
investigate your surroundings thoroughly, looking out for Chests and other
caches. An innocent-looking tree-stump, or a mound of dirt may contain a
valuable treasure. Ashes never contain anything, but may warn you that enemies 
are nearby. All cities and towns are worth investigating. Don't forget to search 
any conquered enemies. NEVER pick up Rations, until you've checked them closely (by
right-clicking them) - many are Spoiled or Poisoned!</font><p>

<font color=#00cc00>
Save often! Use the BOOKMARK as a short-term SAVE, but by all means use
the SAVE GAME facility whenever you feel you're at a crux of the game, especially
when you think you've performed well at some stage. There will be many stages in
the game where you may come to regret not having saved properly! Always BOOKMARK before
you do anything potentially dangerous, like trying to deactivate a Trapped Chest.
A BOOKMARK just before a combat is a good idea as well. It is essential to have
regular Saves in every Chapter. That way you can always go back later, and replay
the game from a particular point.</font><p>

<font color=#cccc00>
The EYES OF ISHAP Spell is available early in the game, and is extremely useful for spotting 
potentially valuable items in the neighborhood. In order for it to be 100% reliable, Owyn must
cast it at the full 10 points, losing 10 Health/Stamina points every time. If you don't mind a
little cheating, here's a way to the cast the Spell without losing a single point:<p>
<font color=#ffff00>
Before casting EYES OF ISHAP save BOOKMARK.<br>
Now cast the spell, check the area, and carefully note any potential spots.<br>
Restore the BOOKMARK. Now you have the benefit of the spell without any cost!</font><p>
You can use this trick with other Spells as well: NACRE CICATRIX, THE UNSEEN, and UNION.
Union is slightly different from the others. It allows Patrus to read Moredhel. You will
have to note the inital letters appearing on the letter-wheels, solve the riddle, and 
determine the "pattern of clicks" for opening the chest (i.e. click twice on the first
wheel, etc.). Finally restore the BOOKMARK, and apply the pattern.</font><p>

<font color=#00cccc>
When you enter a Tavern, always Bard, in order to improve Owyn's Barding Skills, and make
easy money. In each Chapter you can only Bard once at each Tavern, but you can Bard there
again in another Chapter. You can get two Practice Lutes in Chapter 1 - using them will improve
Owyn's Barding Skill a lot. Before using the Practice Lutes make sure that Owyn's Barding
Skill is the only one Selected - this will make it rise 50% faster!</font><p>

<font color=#ff0000>
Sometimes, while you're Haggling, a Shopkeeper will grow disgusted, and make the Item 
unavailable. No problem - just exit the Shop, and re-enter. The Item will be available again.</font><p>

<font color=#00cc00>
Whenever you've just entered a City, a Tavern or a Shop, use your mouse to investigate all 
areas, otherwise you might miss something. Most cities have "Shop" and "Inn" hotspots, but
a few also have an "Enter" hotspot. Some also exhibit the "Magnifying Glass" Icon, which means
you can find something of interest. But beware: If your mouse is faulty, you can easily miss
some of the hotspots. There's an easy way around this - use the [TAB] Key instead! This will
cycle you through every possibility. Try it!</font><p>

<font color=#ff0000>
There are FOUR types of Chests in the game:</font><p>

<blockquote>

<font color=#cccc00>
ORDINARY CHESTS. <font color=#00cccc>To be opened without further ado.</font><p>

LOCKED CHESTS. <font color=#00cccc>Some can ONLY be Lockpicked (if your Skill is up to it), others can be Lockpicked
AND opened with the proper Key, still others can ONLY be opened with a Special Key. (The same applies
to Locked Doors in Houses and Dungeons.)</font><p>

TRAPPED CHESTS. <font color=#00cccc>The SCENT OF SARIG Spell will determine whether a Chest is trapped or not. If this
Spell is not active, you won't have a clue and the Chest will explode. The damage varies - in some
cases it is nothing to worry about, but in others it is MASSIVE! (It is recommended that you always
BOOKMARK, before attempting to open a Chest.) If the Chest is Trapped and SCENT OF SARIG has been
cast, you can attempt to deactivate the trap. Your success will depend on your Lockpicking Skill.
Note: If the Lockpicker holds the AMULET OF THE UPRIGHT MAN, his Skill will be improved by 15% (cumulative).
Make sure any AMULETS you have are held by your BEST Lockpicker!
</font><p>

MOREDHEL WORDLOCK CHESTS. <font color=#00cccc>All you need is to solve a riddle.</font><p>
</font>
</blockquote>

<font color=#ff0000>
IMPROVING LOCKPICKING SKILL.</font>
<font color=#00cc00>
Every time you use a Picklock, your Skill will rise a notch. If you
use it successfully, you will gain even more. If the Lockpicking Skill is the ONLY Skill Selected,
it will rise 50% faster. This means that the best way for improving this Skill is to find a Lock
you can successfully Lockpick, make sure that ONLY this Skill is selected, and then go at it, opening
the Lock repeatedly, until you faint from utter boredom!</font><p>

<font color=#ff0000>
IMPROVING HAGGLING SKILL.</font>
<font color=#00cc00>You can slowly raise your Haggling Skill by Haggling repeatedly at every opportunity. In every Shop you
enter, pretend you want to buy every single item, and Haggle, until the Shopkeeper refuses to sell it to you. When you've
Haggled every item in the Shop into oblivion, just exit and then re-enter the Shop again in order to make all the goods available
once more. Repeat until sanity fades.<p>

<font color=#ff0000>
IMPROVING MELEE/DEFENSE SKILLS.</font>
<font color=#00cc00>Practice makes perfect. Any ENDLESS combat is a good place for
practicing. The Prelate's House East of Kenting Rush is probably the best. It is surrounded by
Guards, who will refuse to let you through unless you've spoken to the Priest in the Temple of
Kahooli. Attack them! After the first Combat, they will be much weaker. Fight them as often as
you can. You can raise your Combat Skills drastically here, if you're patient, and Owyn's Casting
Skill as well. When you've raised your skills as much as you want, you can just stand around and
rest, and let those wimpy Guards attack you until they all give up and run away - this will raise
your Defense Skills.<p>

<font color=#cccc00>
MANAGING YOUR INVENTORIES.</font>
<font color=#00cccc>You will often need to move Items from one inventory to another. Example:
In order to repair Weapons and Armor you will get the best results from the Character with the
best Weaponcraft and Armorcraft Skills. In order to manage this, the Weapon/Armor in question 
needs to be moved into this Character's inventory, but there may not be room enough! You can 
solve this by temporarily storing Items in a BAG, or in another character's inventory.<p>

If you find or gain an Item, and there is no room in ANY of your characters' inventories, the
Item will go into a nearby BAG. In order to empty the BAG you will have to throw something
away! If you leave something in a BAG, and return to it later, it may get stolen in the meantime.<p>

You may sometimes want to temporarily store some of your possessions in a Bag, or any other Cache.
This is always risky. However, if you include a SPYNOTE in the Bag, it will be much safer.
(Don't ask me why!) Never leave anything in the Prank's Stone/Temple of Banath area, it will get
stolen FAST! [In version 1.02 Moredhel Chests are 100% safe places to stash your stuff, I'm told. I
haven't tested this, so don't take my word for it.]<p>

If your inventory holds more than one of the same Item, always use the one with the least value
first. Example: If you have two Whetstones, one containing 4 charges, the other 12 charges, use 
the 4-charge one first, in order to free up the slot.<p>

<font color=#ff0000>
If you have plenty of Restoratives, you can easily regain lost Health/Stamina and cure yourself of
any Condition. However, Restoratives are very precious, so you shouldn't use them unless 
necessary. A good night's sleep will often achieve the same effect, especially if you use Herbal Packs
before sleeping in the open, or drink some Ale or Wine before sleeping at a Tavern.</font><p>

<font color=#00cccc>
Look out for the drastically varying prices in the Shops you visit. Also note the Shop's specialities.
Not all Shops by all Items. (Consult the Shop Web for info.) In some cases Shop prices may vary so much
that you may gain from Teleporting in order to get the best price. [This is particularly relevant in
version 1.01, where the Prank's Stone Shop gives extravagant prices for Gems.]<p>
 
More on Shops: If a shop buys an item from you, it will become part of the Shop's stock 
permanently! There are many ways to utilize this feature, but basically they involve selling
the item, and then buying it back again. You will, of course, need to spend some money on such
a transaction, but if you do so, the item will be permanently available in this shop! This means
you can buy MORE, and also make it available in later chapters. But bear in mind: You only need 
to sell ONE UNIT! Example: You have 8 Naphtha, and want to add it to a Shop's stock. Keep 7,
sell 1. You will lose 1 Naphtha, make some money, and Naphtha will be available from the Shop 
permanently. If you're filthy rich, you can utilize this by re-buying the Naphtha endlessly,
thus duplicating your original Naphtha as many times as you want.</font><p>

<font color=#ff0000 size=+1>
SPELL TIPS</font><br><font color=#cccc00>

Some Spells, especially EYES OF ISHAP, NACRE CICATRIX and THE UNSEEN are totally unreliable
unless you spend the full amount of points.<p>

Some Spells, although seemingly weak (and cheap), can be extremely useful. DESPAIR
THY EYES is a good example of this: It will cost the Caster next to nothing AND be
very useful (although it needs to be cast regularly).<p>

Some Spells last for a time proportional to the points you spend on it. Don't overspend!
Example: You can cast a Spell, and have a choice of spending 5-30 points, meaning that the
Spell will last for 5-30 rounds. If you're in Combat Mode, and foresee the end of the Combat
within, say, 10 rounds, DO NOT spend more than 10 points! Anything beyond that is pure waste,
and you can always re-cast the Spell anyway. (The same applies when casting Spells in Traps.)<p>

Near Romney, you can obtain FETTERS OF RIME from a Moredhel Chest. This one is a MUST - don't
miss it! You will almost certainly come to rely on this one a lot! In addition to Damage, it 
will freeze your opponents for a number of rounds.<p>

Near Sarth, you can find SKIN OF THE DRAGON. This is essential. You can also buy it, but of 
course you won't, if you can get it gratis. If you have both FETTERS and SKIN, you can 
technically finish the game, without gaining any other Spells (except for STRENGTH DRAIN in
Chapter 8). But of course you will want all the Spells you can get! My favourites include
EVIL SEEK, MAD GOD'S RAGE, TOUCH OF LIMS-KRAGMA and FIRESTORM, but this doesn't mean a thing.
Other players prefer the more esoteric ones, like MIRRORWALL, GAMBIT OF THE EIGHT, RIVER SONG.</font><p>

<font color=#ff0000>GRATIS RECOVERY OF HEALTH/STAMINA.</font>
<font color=#00cc00> TRAPS are excellent for this. If your Characters need
to regain lost Health/Stamina points, enter a Trap, and REST as long as you need. No
TIME passes in Traps, so no Rations will be spent.<p>

You can perform a similar trick during Combat. When only one Enemy is left, FREEZE him with
an appropriate Spell or a Powder Bag, and then REST your Characters as long as you can.
If, by the time the enemy gets unfrozen, you still haven't recovered fully, the enemy will
probably try to flee, in which case you can cast the Invitation Spell. Repeat, until your
characters are fully recovered.<p>

<font color=#00cccc>
TRAPS. If you have SKIN OF THE DRAGON, you can barge through any Trap in the game, without solving it.
The Spellcaster will lose points, but they can be regained by RESTING, before exiting the Trap.
Solving Traps is a lot of fun, though!<p>

<font color=#ff0000>
THE ARMS OF DALA</font><font color=#cccc00>
Shop in Wolfram is a good place to buy Weapons and Armor. Apart from
being the cheapest Shop in the game, it has lots of 50% and 75% stuff, which means it's
even cheaper. You should be able to repair everything satisfactorily, and then the
Temple of Tith is just a few steps away - you can get everything Blessed with a #3
Blessing here. During the Guild War, you can also go here, buy a lot of cheap Greatswords,
repair them, and then sell them in Romney at outrageous prices! You can do
this as often as you want.</font><p>

<a name=tricks>
<font size=+2 color=ff0000>
MONEY-MAKING TRICKS!</font><p>

Don't miss the <a href="stackbug.html">STACKBUG TRICK</a> and the
<a href="crbtrick.html">BROKEN CROSSBOW TRICK</a>, both of which have
special pages devoted to them!<p>

<font color=#cccc00>
MAKING MONEY IN TANNEURS.<br><font color=#00cc00>
James David Allan (in Manitoba) has pointed out the following procedure,
which basically allows you to earn as much money as you wish! At Tom's
Tavern in Tanneurs your regular Barding Fee will be 130 Gold, if your skill
is 100%. When you enter the Taver, first Bard, and then talk to Spitzer the
Gambler. He is always ready to gamble, unless you are in the middle of the
Quest for the Collector, in which case he won't, until you've found the
collector, and sent him to the Temple of Silban. The procedure is as follows:<p>

Talk with Spitzer, and gamble (the maximum 50).<br> 
If you win, he will stop. Talk to him again, and gamble. Do this until you lose.<br> 
When you lose, stop gambling. Now you can Bard again, earning 250 Gold!<p> 

You can repeat the above procedure endlessly, earning amazing amounts of money.
It's not exactly fun, but worth it. (I tried as far as 8000 Gold, before getting bored.)
Note that you can return here (by walking and teleporting) in Chapters 2, 3 and 6, in 
order to earn even more money! You will then run into new enemies, but THAT shouldn't
keep you away from the dough!<p>
</font>

<font color=#00cccc>A Plagued House south of the Temple of Lims-Kragma
contains some money (34 Gold). A weird feature here, probably not intended by the
programmers, is that you can enter the house as many times as you want, and find the 
money each time, if you don't mind getting the plague! If you're patient enough you 
can amass a fortune here. You will get Plagued 50% when you enter for the first time,
and Plagued 100% for the second time. After that it doesn't matter how often you enter.
You can easily cure yourself of the plague afterwards, either with Restoratives, or a
combination of Herbal Packs and Sleep.</font><p>

<font color=#cccc00>
MAKING MONEY DURING THE GUILD WAR.</font><br><font color=#ff0000>
At the beginning of Chapter 3 the Guild War is on, and will be until you finish it.
During the Guild War, prices at the Romney Shop will be sixfold. You can utilize this 
by selling all kinds of junk here at extravagant prices. Here's how you can take advantage 
of the situation in order to make MASSES OF MONEY:<p>
Before you make an end to the Guild War, march North to the Temple of Banath, and from there
Teleport to the Temple of Tith. In the Arms of Dala Shop you can buy Greatswords (50%) for
300 Gold (hagglable down to 240 Gold). Buy as many Greatswords as you can
carry and have Gorath repair them. Now Teleport back to Banath, then go to Romney and sell 
the Greatswords. If you can repair them to 100% condition, they will sell at 648 Gold.
Repeat as often as you want. (And remember that you can use the Cheat Chest as an extra Backpack.
This will save you a lot of journeying back and forth.)</font><p>

<font color=#00cc00>POISONED QUARRELS RESALE TRICK.</font><br><font color=#00cccc>
The value of Poisoned Quarrels is more than five times that of Ordinary Quarrels.
Quarrels can be Poisoned by using Silverthorn (at a cost), or the Silver Spider (gratis).
As soon as you're in Chapter 3, you will automatically have the Spider, allowing you to Poison 
Quarrels freely. In a few Shops which have Quarrels for sale, this means you 
can buy Ordinary Quarrels, Poison them, and then sell them back at a PROFIT!
The best place to perform this trick is NIA'S GOODS in Chapter 3, i.e. if
you have solved Nia's Quest in order to open up the shop. Here you can
Buy, Poison and Sell at a Profit of 22.4 per Quarrels [25]. (Haggling may
result in a slightly larger profit.) This can be repeated endlessly, until
you're as rich as you need.<p>
In other Shops, the Profit is too small for bothering with. But if you happen 
to be dying for an extra couple of Sovereigns in any of these Shops, this might 
be your solution.<p>
As already stated you can make at least 22.4 from each transaction at Nia's Goods.
You can make 12.2 if you're here in Chapter 1. Other possiblities are Fletcher's
Post in LaMut (11.8), Sign of the Eagle in Krondor (5.9), Split Tree Goods in
Caldara (4.8), and The Armory in Malac's Cross (2.1).</font><p>

<font color=#cccc00>LIMM'S PICKLOCKS. Limm is found at the entrance to the Krondor Sewers
in Chapters 1, 2, 3 and 6, and will sell you Picklocks [12] for 25 Gold (repeatedly).
This is a very good price! In a shop the cheapest price possible for Picklocks [12] would be 105
Gold. This means that you can sell Limm's Picklocks at a profit in most shops (if they buy Picklocks).
The problem here is that neither of the Krondor shops will buy them. The closest shop is The Mercantile in Darkmoor,
where you can sell 12 Picklocks at 38.2. This means a profit of 13.2 per each set of 12. The closest
shop after that is Nia's Goods (Chapter 2 after solving her Quest), where 12 Picklocks will be bought
at 55.6, resulting in 30.6 profit. There is room for 36 Picklocks in each slot your Inventories.
Of course you can utilize the Cheat Chest, and stuff it full of Limm's Picklocks, then go to Darkmoor and
try to sell them. I haven't bothered to try, but if you decide to experiment with
this feature, please let me know, if you find it worth the effort.</font><p>

<font color=#ff0000>
Finally, a truly devious Money-Making Scheme (discovered by Jay Sevara). Please note that
this works much better in Version 1.01. In this version the Prank's Stone Shop is extremely
expensive, but in Version 1.02 it is quite ordinary. The following description is based on
Version 1.01.</font><p>

<font color=#00ffff>
In a house in PRANK'S STONE, an Inventor will offer to turn your Rubies into
Diamonds. He can do this, but they're only 2% Diamonds! The price of a 2% Diamond
is roughly equivalent to an 8% Ruby, so unless your Rubies are extremely poor, this
is obviously not worth doing. However, there is a way to utilize this feature. It
is quite complex, but extraordinarily devious. I cannot resist including it here.<p>

In Chapter 1 there is a side-quest which involves finding Makala's Ruby. It is an
extremely poor 1% Ruby. By returning it to the LaMut Garrison, you will be rewarded.
This seems pretty straightforward, but here's what you need to do:<p>

When you bring the Ruby back to LaMut, don't return it immediately. Sell it in the LaMut
Shop for 2s8r. (It will now be permanently in stock here.) Then buy it back for 8s2r.
And buy another one! You now have TWO 1% Rubies. Return one to the Garrison, in order
to reap your reward. Keep the other one.<p>

The next step calls for you to be situated in the Romney - Prank's Stone area,
before or after the Guild War. (This is possible in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6.) 
You must have some funds, approximately 500 Gold. First make sure you've killed all enemies
between Romney and Prank's Stone. Then camp near Romney and get a good night's sleep. Now DROP
every single item in your inventories, except for that 1% Ruby. (I know this is risky, but if 
your Bag or Chest is somewhat off the beaten track, preferably containing a Spynote, you can 
easily get away with this.)<p>

Now enter Romney, carrying NOTHING BUT THE 1% RUBY. Sell it to the Shop at 1s3r.
Now buy back 60 (!) of those. Each of your three characters has room for 20 Rubies.
(You'll spend a maximum of 540 Gold, but Haggling can minimize this to 420 Gold.)<p>

Now march to the Inventor's house in Prank's Stone. Have him convert all 60 Rubies
into 2% Diamonds.<p>

Finally, sell all the Diamonds in the Prank's Stone Shop. It'll pay 63s1r for each, resulting 
in a profit of over 3000 Gold Sovereigns!<p>
</font>

Unfortunately the Shop will only pay 18s for each Diamond in Version 1.02 of the game. This means
that the profit will only be about 600 Gold for 60 Diamonds, so you'll have to repeat this 5 times
in order to gain the same amount of money as in the older version. The good news is that since the
Prank's Stone Shop is inexpensive in Version 1.02, you can perform the whole procedure without
leaving Prank's Stone. The Romney Shop is no longer needed.<p>
<font color=#ffcc99>
SPECIAL TIP: Robert West has pointed out that in version 1.02
you can actually profit by over 3000 Gold Sovereigns, DURING THE GUILD WAR, by buying the
Rubies in Prank's Stone and selling the Diamonds in Romney! The Webmaster is extremely grateful
to Robert for thus making this clever scheme "version-proof"!<p></font>  

<center><font size=+1 color=#ff0000>Here's a mind-bending scheme for you to contemplate!<br>
<font color=#cccccc>WARNING: Only possible in VERSION 1.01!</font><p>
Gorath can't find a Bessy Mauler until very late in Chapter 6.<br>
Wouldn't it be great if he could get one sooner? Here's a way:<p></center></font>

Make sure James, Locklear and Patrus have plenty of money to spend in Raglam
in Chapter 5. (The Siege Towers in the area contain lots of Elven Crossbows
and other stuff you can sell at the Raglam Shop.) This Shop has Bessy Maulers for sale, at 1125 Gold. They
are only 75%, but you should be able to repair them. If not, you can buy Heavy Bowstrings in this Shop as well.
James and Locklear will, of course, want to buy Maulers for themselves, but why not have them buy an extra
one for Gorath? And while you're at it, buy lots of those Flaming Quarrels as well.<p>

When they return to the Northwarden area, go to the Chests, where you poisoned the Rations earlier. Put
Gorath's Bessy Mauler in the northernmost Chest. (For some reason this Chest seems to be safer than the
others.) Leave a good supply of Flaming Quarrels here as well. And if you still have money enough, why not
visit the Dencamp Shop, buy lots of Enchanted Quarrels, and leave some in the Chest as well?<p>

At the beginning of Chapter 6, once you get out of the Sewers, go to the Temple of Astalon, and teleport
to the Temple of Tith, near Wolfram. Now go and have Gorath fetch his Bessy Mauler and all those nice Quarrels.
(He can buy Enchanted Quarrels in Dencamp or Sarth.) Finally teleport back to Krondor, or wherever you want to
go next.<p>

And, by the way, if James and company don't need to sell the Diamonds Tamney gave them, don't do it! Leave them
in the Chest with all the other stuff, for Gorath to pick up. Gorath and Owyn are not likely to be carrying a lot
of money at the start of Chapter 6, so they would love to have a Diamond or two. If you can manage this, you should
have them teleport to the Temple of Banath first, in order to sell the Diamonds in Prank's Stone.<p>

<font color=#0000ff>
A FOOTNOTE: Can Gorath ever repay James and Locklear? Yes, he can! He can supply them with Guarda Revanches in
Chapter 7! If you think this is impossible, think again. All the clues are here, on this very page!<p>
