A middle aged woman met James at the door.<p>
"Good day to y--" he began. The sentence hung, unfinished, in the air.<p>
"Come in! My, aren't you fellows handsome? My name is Elizabeth. Are you married? My sister 
Caroline is a lovely young girl and I think she would be just perfect for you. Would you like
to meet her? Well, never mind that for now. Come in, come in."<p>
As the woman drug them into the house, Owyn marvelled at the way she seemed to be able to talk 
without ever taking a breath.<p>
"My husband would agree if he was here, but he works at The Mercantile, you know, the store 
just down the road. Does pretty well for himself, that's why we have this house too. He had this
house built just for me. Can you imagine? I used to help him at the Shop, but now he insists I 
stay here all day long - isn't he just the sweetest man?"<p>
After several more minutes, that felt like hours, James excused himself politely and they
headed for the door.  The woman called after them as they left, but they pretended not to hear.<p>

After knocking on the small wooden door, James stood back to survey the house and its 
surroundings. "Darkmoor seems friendly enough," he said.<p>
The door swung open and his attention shifted to a smallish woman who greeted him with a hug.
"Oh my. Aren't you a dear? My name is Caroline, what's your name?" Before James had a chance to 
answer she ushered them all into the house.<p>
Inside, amidst a collection of knick knacks and odds and ends no doubt collected over three 
quarters of a lifetime, they introduced themselves. They talked for several minutes as she 
refilled their water pouches with a pitcher sitting on a small wooden table in the corner.<p>
"Have you seen the crazy old hen that lives down the road?" she queried, breathlessly. Only 
comes out at night. My sister Elizabeth thinks she's a witch or something. I just think she's 
crazy. Can't really blame her -- husband and son were both killed by evil spirits. That's what 
they say."<p>
Their pouches full, they managed to work their way to the door. The woman was still talking as 
she closed the door behind them.<p>

After knocking several times, James had just about concluded that nobody was home. "Come on," he
said in Owyn's general direction. "There doesn't seem to be anyone about."<p>
Just as he was preparing to leave, a shuffling sound inside the house caught his attention.<p>
"Hello! Is anybody there?" he shouted.<p>
For several more seconds he heard nothing but silence and again he was about to leave. This 
time a hoarse whisper stopped his exit, though he couldn't make out what the voice on the other 
side of the door was saying.<p>
"You'll have to speak a little louder. We're just passing through but we would like to talk to 
you," James said.<p>
"Come back when the sun is no longer in the sky," croaked the voice, "and I will tell you about 
the Rusalki." Hissing emphasis was placed on this last word.<p>
James tried to get some further information but he was greeted with nought but silence. "Come
on, he said. "Let's get going."<p>

</td><td valign=top>

The moon hung in the cloudy sky like a pale lantern.<p>
"Come in," said a gruff voice.<p>
They opened the door to the small dwelling and walked into a room lit by close to a hundred 
candles. Shadows danced crazily on the walls, a sight so distracting it took James several 
moments before he noticed the strange old woman sitting crosslegged on the floor.
No words were exchanged, but they walked across the room and sat on the floor in front of her.<p>
"I shall speak of the Rusalki." As the woman spoke she began to rock gently back and forth, her 
gravelly voice taking on a songlike quality. "Innocence lost. Lost. Spring blossoms robbed of 
carnal bliss, the Goddess of death their first kiss. Their first kiss."<p>
Candlelight flashed in the wetness of her eyes as she continued. "They will shrink away from her
touch, they hate her so. Hate her so. Find the Magic Touch or you too may feel her icy kiss."<p>
The woman's head dropped to her lap and James got up to leave. He started to speak, but thought
better of it. They left the house as quietly as possible.

Entering the house it became obvious that someone had indeed conducted a fairly thorough search.
Seeing nothing of interest James turned to leave. "Come on, let's get out of here. It maybe too 
late al--" He stopped in mid sentence as his eyes fell on a discolored floorboard in the corner 
of the room.<p>
Crossing the small house in three giant strides he carefully used the tip of his sword to pry 
the board up, then he slipped his fingers under and gave it several hard tugs. The board came 
free with a splintering "crack." James slowly reached down into the dark rectangular hole and 
excitedly pulled out a small bag. Spilling the shiny contents of the bag on the floor, he began 
to count...<p>
"Thirty four gold sovereigns!" he said. Probably the life savings of the unfortunate
family that lived here. We will have need of this money, but I'll be sure to give a charitable 
donation of equal size to Father Tully should we ever see Krondor again. Now, let's get out of 
here. We may be paying for this small windfall with our lives."

decorated the interior, he guessed the house belonged to Max Feeber. "This is odd" he said,

Alerted by the incongruity, something told him to investigate the farmer's belongings

stepped back with a shrug.<p>

"Doesn't seem that anyone's about," Owyn said.

The figure of a small elderly man followed the disembodied voice around the edge of the house.
"I was out back tending to some chores. You're right about the symbols being magic though.
Carved 'em there myself. Name's Flarr Wygn."<p>
Thrilled to be in the presence of another magician, Owyn smiled and said, "It would've been
easier to do it magically, Flarr."<p>
"I suspect you're right about that. But I'm not a magician. No, it was my brother who had the 
gift. Died a couple years back." The old man stared solemnly at the door for a moment, then 
suddenly cheerful said, "Left behind a magic well. His legacy. Its guarded by a pretty nasty

James asked for company.<p>
Smiling at them, the man eagerly accepted the offer of fellowship and told a 
number of tales about his works for Lord Lyton. Unsure what in the man's manner 
inspired his trust, James responded likewise by telling him a few of the details 
of their trip to Romney, though omitting the specifics about Gorath's part in 
things.<p>
"Ah we! I don't envy you that," the man said, waving his hands. "I'd not be 
heading anywhere near the river, not for no amount of silver. Not me."<p>
"Why is that?" James asked.<p>
"Awful troubles there. The Guild of the Romney and the Riverpullers Guild are as 
good as at war. If you ask me, some bloke down Silden way is trying to stir up 
things. I've heard he's even got a few sneaks what are posing as members of 
other guilds, even carrying forged guild seals. Saw a group of them with Max 
Feeber, that greedy bastard out west of here."<p>
When the man excused himself to go answer nature's call, James pondered for a 
moment the things he had learned. While it seemed wildly improbable that the 
events that were going on around them were somehow connected, he had seen the 
plots of Murmandamus previous to the last uprising and those circumstances had 
left him jaded. It made him none the more comfortable that he was now escorting

He invited them into his home, offered them some food and water and spoke of the guild war near
Romney. "It started when the Riverpullers jacked their prices so high no one could afford to
ship things down river," he explained. "That forced Mitchel Waylander to turn to the Guild of
the Romney - well, let me tell you, Chief Reeve of the Riverpullers didn't like that at
all - felt the new guild was trying to undercut his business, but can you blame him?
Mitchel, I mean."<p>

James shook his head."The Duke of Romney doesn't seem too happy about matters either," he said.
"He wants you to come to the negotiations table so they can bring a halt to the violence in
Romney."<p>

Arlie nodded. "Bloody politics started this mess and it looks like that's what it'll take to
bring it to an end. They'll take a chunk out of the Ironmonger's Guild, be sure of that. We've
always lost at the negotiations table."<p>

"Then we can tell the Duke you will negotiate?" James asked.<p>

Walking to a row of shelves, he pulled down a book. "Nothing else to do that I know of."
Alerting Gorath first, he tossed the tome. "Thought you might like this after all your questions
about the ironwork..."<p>

"A beginner's text on the art of repairing arms and armor. I was going to throw it out to make
room for a few new books that Podrich brought to me. You're welcome to it."<p>

"I'm glad we got this chance to talk," he said. "Been a while since I've had a chance to gab

out potential enemies, you're also keeping out potential allies."<p>

SEVEN FALSE PROPHECIES:<p>

Owyn cringed as he found that the mystic was regarding him intensely, fixing him with a gaze
that looked frankly more familiar than he liked. "You shall discover wealth in a hidden place,
but shall lose something dearly won so that you may obtain it. In gaining it, you shall have
great joy, but later will find that it holds great misery for the time ahead."<p>

Staring deep into Owyn's eyes, she hesitated a moment, then shook her head. "I can tell you
nothing you do not already know," she said, then locked gazes with Gorath. "But you, however, I see betrayal
in your future. You will turn on all that you have sworn oath to and will become something you
once hated. You will face your enemy most hated and he will change you."<p>

For a long moment she sat silently, her gaze turned as much inwards as outwards, but at last she
spoke in a startlingly youthful voice. "A long shadow and a star stand over your house," she
said, addressing Locklear. "Even as you find the soul that is kin to your own and achieve all that you
had hoped, you will lose your closest friend to passion in a foreign land."<p>

Regarding James, the look on her face slowly changed, turning into a mask of pain and regret. "You
will die a slow and painful death, alone and in starvation," she said somberly. Those upon whom
you thought you could count will abandon you in your hour of need and in death they will believe
you a disgrace to your station."<p>

A puzzled look crossed Haphra's face as she attempted to concentrate.
"Yours is a fortune I have not seen the like of for some time. A dead man's key will open the
doors which cannot be seen and are hidden beneath those who bow below the seven rayed star."<p>

Her eyes half-closed, she looked dreamily at James, licking her lips as she spoke. "When you are
driven on the longest road, you will seek to destroy the instrument of deception, but will find
need to deceive those who guard the way. In the very last place you will find that salvation is
with the man who seems a boy."<p>

Shivering, as if seized with a sudden chill, she flicked a bony finger out at Owyn.
"You shall save one whom you admire from a dire fate, but shall awaken the attention of those
whom most wish for your destruction. Forever after, you shall find that you walk the paths of
the world nameless and alone."<p></font>

Folding her hands in her lap, she looked on them serenely, her face beginning to resume the look
of her age. "This is the fate I see for you," she said, the slight tremolo in her voice betraying
a hint of nervousness. "The fates have spoken through me..."

James snorted his contempt for the old woman's prediction. "I could have said any of the same
things. I've heard virtually all those things from street lunatics..."<p>

"Haphra!" Bella shouted, but was shoved aside like a mere twig as the old woman lunged to her
feet, her eyes blazing fury. Raking James's face with her sharpened nails, she howled in a voice
that no longer sounded human. I am Haphra! You will believe! You will believe..."<p>

Weeping openly, Bella moved behind his distraught wife, but rather than trying to console her,
he lifted a stick of fire wood and struck her to the floor. Standing over her unconscious form,
he seemed poised to strike again...<p>

"Wha... ," Confused, James flashed a horrified stare at Bella, but suddenly drew back in shock as
another form began to materialize around Haphra's crumpled body, taking on the shape of a young
girl. For a moment it hovered, its expression glowering as it stared at Bella. Then, with a
hateful screech, it flashed through the air to pass through the walls of the house.<p>

"Go after it," Bella sobbed, dropping to the ground to cradle his wife. Go and kill it. We are
finished with the rusalki now. Go!"<p>

Nearly tripping over the clutter of the small house, they rushed outside and prepared their
weapons for the rusalki who now awaited to kill them all.

Bella said nothing as he let them inside.<p>

Next to the door, Haphra was sitting up, her frail fingers clutched in her hair and a distant
look on her face. As she regarded them, she looked more relieved than pained for her injury.<p>

"She is dead?"<p>

"Yes," James replied. "Dead. Or at least we may assume so. What exactly did we witness here?"<p>

"A foolish old woman who didn't wish to let her daughter go," she said, her voice trembling.
Grabbing hold of Bella's hand for support, she continued on bravely. "After our daughter died,
I sought to find her with my talents. I thought if I could seize on to her, we could keep her
with us."<p>

"But that's not what you found," James replied.<p>

Haphra shook her head. "No it wasn't. Instead, I found the spirit of the rusalki who promised
that she would bring our daughter to us, if we would allow her to live through me, to inhabit
this body. For a while we believed her, but after several weeks...we knew we had been trapped
by the creature."<p>

Feeling awkward in the woman's presence, James touched the woman's shoulder lightly. "I am very
sorry."<p>

"Don't be," she said. "You have freed us of a curse and now we can begin to rebuild our lives
without my daughter. For this, I shall grant you a <i>true</i> prophecy, or at least one as
true as I am capable."

He shall be the one who holds the key to an important mystery."<p>

Standing in front of the wooden door Locklear paused to marvel at the construction of the house.
Unlike many such houses, this one had apparently been built quite soundly, and out of good 
materials. He knocked on the solidly built door.<p>
A moment later a large man appeared in the doorway, his sandy colored hair dancing around on his
head thanks to a gentle breeze.
"You fellas come about a house? No one builds 'em better!" he said proudly.<p>
Locklear took a step back. "We were just admiring the fine job you did. Very nice work.
Unfortunately, we're just passing through."<p>

The front door of the small house held a crudely made sign, which read "UNUZEL ITEMS 4 SALE."
James knocked and waited for someone to answer the door.<p>
A tall, shadowy man appeared and ushered them into the house. "You come to buy something, yes?"
he asked through crooked yellow teeth.<p>
"I guess that depends on what you're selling, friend," James replied. They followed the man to
a large wooden table. It was covered with about a dozen items, mostly junk, but one caught 
James's eye. "Tell me about this piece. Where did you get this?" he asked, picking up a 
broken medallion that looked as though it had been stepped on more than once.<p>
The man eyed them nervously. "I found it around here somewhere. Would you like to buy it?"
He made a halfhearted sales pitch, then seemed almost relieved when his offer was rejected and
he was told they had to leave.<p>
Turning to Owyn, James said, "Did you notice the Nighthawk emblem on that medallion? I would 
say there definitely are -- or were -- Nighthawks in this area."

Suddenly, a scrawny ball of fur exploded out of the house, raking Gorath painfully across the

"Damnation!" Locklear cried. "Cat must've been trapped in there for days!" He caught his breath,
then went over to check on Gorath's injury.

extended his hand. "Welcome to the Upturned Keg. Best brewery this side of the Romney. Would you
care to sample some of our stock? We make a dandy apple wine..."<p>

"I'm sure you do, but no thank you," James said. "We have other business with you. Have you
recently sent a special delivery to the Black Sheep Tavern in Romney?"<p>

The man nodded. "Yes. A man here in town named Mitchel Waylander came in and made the purchase 
order himself. Paid with rubies."<p>

Recognizing the name of the leader of the Glazer's Guild of Romney, James arched an eyebrow.
"Was there anything unusual about the order?"<p>

"I'll say," the man replied. Moving to a small bin, he pulled out a handful of a substance that
looked like tabac, letting it sift between his fingers back into the bin. "He asked that I add 
this to the kegs - called black tarweed."<p>

"A poison?" James asked.<p>

"No. It's a cheat used by the less scrupulous tavern keepers. Handful of this dissolved in your
ale, and whoever drinks it will think they're dying of thirst. Gets worse the more you drink."<p>

Gorath spat. "It is often done in the north," he said. "A man will drink until he is no longer
capable, either for lack of gold or wit."<p>

"And an excellent way to make certain that someone is incapable of fighting you back," James
said with disgust. "The Nighthawks aren't what they used to be."<p>

Alarmed, the brewmaster seemed to pale. "Nighthawks? What have they to do with this?"<p>

Omitting most of the smaller details, James told what they had already learned of the murder.
Horrified, the man shook his head. "I assure you, this has never once happened in association 
with the Keg. If you would like, I will get you something to drink. I guarantee that it has not
been laced with the black tarweed..."
