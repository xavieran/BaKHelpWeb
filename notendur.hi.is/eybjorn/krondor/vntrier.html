A figure lurched from the mines.<p>

Startled, Owyn drew in a breath, but next to him Gorath remained unfazed, his gaze filled with 
sharp defiance at the mercenary's sudden appearance, as if he had anticipated the arrival.<p>

The man had black hair, cropped short over his expansive forehead, revealing a dark birthmark 
which curled from his hairline to just below his left eye. Looking them over, he nodded to 
Gorath.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>VENUTRIER:</font>
What business do you have here, moredhel? This is my private stake.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Your claim was unknown to us. We saw the cave and assumed it might be a good place to bed down 
for the night.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>VENUTRIER:</font>
You know of the claim now and I'd advise you not to forget that Venutrier of Lan runs things
here. Now push off.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Of course. Good day to you.<p>

A figure lurched from the mines.<p>

The man had black hair, cropped short over his expansive forehead, revealing a dark birthmark 
which curled from his hairline to just below his left eye. Looking them over, he nodded to 
Gorath.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>VENUTRIER:</font>
You're trespassing on private property, moredhel. This area is restricted for commerce, not 
loitering.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
But I am very interested in your commerce sir and that is the very reason I sought you out. I 
wish to sell you the boy.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
What?!!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>VENUTRIER:</font>
Pah, pitiful! He bawls like a calf! We'd have to feed him a herd to get enough meat on his bones.
He's weak, probably diseased. Doesn't look as if he's eaten in weeks.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
His looks are deceptive. Singlehandedly he slew my partner with a kitchen knife and he broke my 
mate's arm. He will grow into an even stronger man.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>VENUTRIER:</font>
Impressive, but he sounds like trouble. We'd have to fight him every day to keep him from 
escaping.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
I'm not getting sold to anybody!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
A mercenary is of little good if he is easily overcome, don't you think? Break his will and he 
will be invaluable to you.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>VENUTRIER:</font>
He looks noble and I don't want bounty hunters sent from the Kingdom in my business.<p> 

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
He was a chamber boy of no importance. You'll have no trouble with him.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Of no importance?!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>VENUTRIER:</font>
A hundred fifty sovereigns, take it or leave it. But before we clap hands on this, would you 
care to view our operations here?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
An intriguing notion... If it would not trouble you?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>VENUTRIER:</font>
No trouble at all. My guards will escort you.<p>

Moredhel surrounded them.<p>

Chuckling to himself, Venutrier looked the pair of them over as if they were oxen bought at the 
market, examining first Owyn and then Gorath with greater interest. "Too easy," he said with a 
sigh. "What kind of fool do you take me for? The boy is of no use, Gorath, but you are a prime 
slave indeed. You will enjoy your new life below."<p>

Seized by a myriad of hands, they were dragged to the mouth of the cavern and thrown in. For an 
eternity it seemed they stumbled down steps...<p>

Venutrier emerged from the mines.<p>

An astonished look fixed on his features, he looked to Gorath and Owyn, shaking his head.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
I have looked over your caves, Venutrier, and I am appalled they are run so poorly. Delekhan 
will be sorely disappointed you have done ill with your stake.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>VENUTRIER:</font>
What has he to do with this? I see only a renegade moredhel and a sapling of a boy! How does 
your leader enter into this?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
His son Moraeulf has sent him word you harbor traitors and has plans to send his assistants to 
come and attend to you. I have come and found no such traitors, but detain me and I guarantee 
he shall be on you.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>VENUTRIER:</font>
And why should I believe you? He has called for your head!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Rumor. I have also heard word that Murmandamus sleeps yet in Sar-Sargoth, but as you like - if 
you enjoy taking risks.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>VENUTRIER:</font>
Bah! Be off with you then. I have no use for either of you! Stay clear of these caves.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
We will leave you conduct your business undisturbed.<p>
