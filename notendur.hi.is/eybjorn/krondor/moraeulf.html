<font color=#ffcc00>MORAEULF:</font>
What have you? Make it brief.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Sar-Sargoth has been besieged. Lord Narab and an unknown number of confidants freed dissidents 
trapped in the dungeons and fled north. Delekhan requests that you and the remaining members of 
the Six lend immediate assistance.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MORAEULF:</font>
Madness! I have my troops in position, ready to march and our target is only a week's expedition
from here. If we leave now, we will not be in position when the time comes for the final strike!
Surely Delekhan doesn't intend to divert us into the snowplains to chase a handful of cowards?!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
The intentions of your father are unknown to me. I merely bring his message. Further, he 
requests progress reports on your activities.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MORAEULF:</font>
If he were not my father, I would slit his impertinent throat! What does he wish to know?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Your father has expressed concern that he has been inadequately informed about the 
activities of the Six. He demands an immediate report.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MORAEULF:</font>
Father knows as well as I how the Six conduct their business! They do not report to 
me anything beyond complaints their lodgings are too cold and that they do not care for 
the food! I do not trust their motives. They speak only to their leader and he comes only 
when it suits him. If it were my decision to make, I would turn them all into the snow and 
let them freeze.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
But they are crucial to the attack at Northwarden, are they not?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MORAEULF:</font>
Northwarden is of little importance. It's the goal beyond that concerns me. What shall 
happen should we have Murmandamus back among our ranks?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
How would that be possible? Murmandamus is dead.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MORAEULF:</font>
I will answer my father's questions, messenger, but I am not here for your own 
curiosity.<p>

The guards at the Inclindel Bridge have turned back goods stolen from the Kingdom. We need the

<font color=#ffcc00>MORAEULF:</font>
Where do you go with them?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
With us, back to the mustering at Sar-Sargoth. The supplies are desperately needed 
there. Many hungry soldiers to feed.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MORAEULF:</font>
My soldiers are hungrier. You have new orders. You are to stop in Harlech with the 
shipment before proceeding north. We shall take what is needed.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
I don't believe Delekhan will be too pleased...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MORAEULF:</font>
Delekhan be damned! If he likes, he may come here and retrieve the goods himself, 
but I will take them! Tell the men at the bridge you are a Serpentslayer. I shall expect 
the supplies immediately.<p>

we could understand one another better?<p>

<i>Sebah!</i> How progresses the transfer from the Tsurani gate?<p>

We were ambushed, Lord Moraeulf! Several men, heavily armed were moving through the Dimwood. We 
were lucky to escape!<p>

Kingdom soldiers?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Perhaps... I know they weren't under our standards so they probably weren't mercenary. We heard 
sounds farther off from where they came from. It might be a whole army.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MORAEULF:</font>
Obkhar may have reached someone and raised the alarm. Damn! This will complicate the march to 
Sethanon. How close were they to the Six's rift-machine?<p>

No idea. We got turned around during the attack... Our couriers were killed and we needed field 
reports. We hoped you could help us.<p>

No. Failed just before the magicians sent us and it is beyond repair with what they have. They
