THE CHAPTER BEGINS<br>
</font>
</center>

<blockquote>

The war drums had begun at dawn.<p>

Stalking quietly the corridors of the ancient fortress, Narab carried 
a witchlight to illumine his way. As he approached the doors to the 
Great Hall, two moredhel guards dressed in full battle regalia stood 
away. They made no sound as he whisked past nor blinked at the sight of 
him.<p>

"Greetings, Narab," a cold voice called from the throne. "It has long 
been since I have seen your face in Sar-Sargoth. Have you grown bolder 
or more the fool?"<p>

Narab knelt at the base of the throne and kissed Delekhan's foot. "That 
is for you to decide. If my words are not to your liking, then my life 
is yours."<p>
 
"It is already mine." Delekhan's wolfish eyes blazed in the darkness. 
"Speak," he commanded.<p>

"I have just returned from a journey into the Kingdom. I bring a 
prize."<p>
 
"I have no interest in valueless baubles."<p>

"This is no bauble," Narab said, cutting off Delekhan, "and I think you 
will find it is of great value."<p>

"And would it have name, this thing?"<p>

"Yes, my lord. Its name is Gorath!" Narab sneered pridefully as he 
awaited his leader's praise, awaited the words that would restore his 
place in moredhel favor and rescind the order of death on his head. 
Perhaps he would even have a place among the new lords...<p>

Delekhan lunged from his throne, his razor edged gauntlet tilling a 
bloody seam across Narab's face as he lashed him backwards.<p>

"You've wrecked everything, you dog!" Delekhan bellowed.<p>

"But...I have brought back the enemy of the Northlands!" Narab 
sputtered, blood dripping from his torn lips. "With Gorath captive we 
can proceed with our..."<p>

"You...know...nothing!"<p>

Narab retreated, suddenly aware that his efforts were wasted, that his 
oath of loyalty meant nothing to his hateful lord. Resolutely he 
stifled a flash of pain as the moredhel leader thundered towards the 
doors.<p>

"And what of my life?" Narab whispered.<p>

Halting, Delekhan turned and hissed, "It is forfeit!"<p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

Owyn didn't want to be awake.<p>

Perhaps it was the drugs they had given him or the endless walking that 
he'd done in the past month and a half. All he could think about was 
sleeping now, that restful non-existence that interrupted the beatings 
and the hauling and the exhaustion. He just wanted to sleep but that 
irritating jangle wouldn't let him. Where was it coming from?<p>

"Gorath?" Owyn asked. "Are you there?"<p>

Suddenly the jangle rattled louder, this time accompanied by a loud 
creak and a flood of torch light as bright as the sun. Out of that 
glowing corona lumbered the largest moredhel he had yet seen...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DELEKHAN:</font>
I see my assistants have been overzealous in their efforts to sedate 
you! It is proper to tremble when you are addresed by Delekhan, leader 
of the unified tribes of the Northlands!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DELEKHAN:</font>
We found this among your things, Kingdom dog. Tell me where you were 
going with it!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
We weren't taking it anywhere. We just picked up everything we could 
and ran. We needed gold...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DELEKHAN:</font>
A lie! The seal that the Nighthawks use for our messages was broken. 
The new writing at the bottom of the page confirms your guilt. What 
does Gabot's Folly mean? Who are Arthur and Jimmy the Hand?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
I really have no idea. Someone else must have beaten us to it and 
opened the scroll before we got there. We took what we found and left 
before we got nabbed. Do you want us to cut you in on the booty?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DELEKHAN:</font>
What I want is information! Your companion Gorath damns you as 
certainly as your lie does. Until he betrayed his own, he was second in 
power only to me. He shall die for his disloyalty.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DELEKHAN:</font>
Since you choose to remain silent, I shall have your tongue and feed it 
to my rats. Have back your message, spy. It will do you little good in 
your grave.<p>

Delekhan stalked away.<p>

Still rattled by his interrogation, Owyn tried to collect his fuzz 
coated thoughts into a coherent whole. Thankfully, his wits had 
provided the lies as needed, but only narrowly had he avoided the 
impulse to tell everything he knew. It was almost as if he was being 
prodded, coerced, bewitched...<p>

Magic?<p>
 
Astonished he had been unaware of it at the time, the boy looked again 
at the bulky warrior who now stood whispering over Gorath's limp form. 
At first he believed Delekhan was incanting a spell, one perhaps 
intended to coerce the truth from his victim, but after a few moments 
it became clear the warlord was conversing with his barely conscious 
friend.<p>

"No!" Gorath croaked, shaking his head.<p>

"...plans...unfulfilled," Delekhan whispered finally. Abruptly he 
struck...<p>

It was too much to absorb.<p>

Even if the events unfurling before him weren't openly damning, Owyn 
had seen enough to keep him swimming in a sea of doubts, all of them 
centering on the loyalty of his friend and traveling companion. Worse 
still, he had to deliver the message to Prince Arutha outside the 
Dimwood and he would need Gorath's help to do it. Desperately he wished 
he had time to sort things out, but time was the one commodity he 
didn't have.<p>

"Enjoy your deaths. I know I shall." Delekhan's scratchy voice snatched 
Owyn out of his thoughts, directed his attention to where the moredhel 
stood in the doorway gesturing to someone in the dungeon corridor.
From nowhere a monolithic door swung into place and once again the room 
was a land of shadows.<p> 

Experimentally, Owyn struck the bars of his cage, knowing full well the 
corroded structure was too solid to yield. But even as his fingertips 
came a way from the metal, the bars began a keening vibration, the iron 
harmonies evocative of distant temple bells.<p>

Someone was working magic...and it wasn't him.<p>

Owyn wasted no time.<p>

Later, he could debate to his heart's content about who it was that had 
set them free and what their reasons for doing so might be, but at the 
moment he had no thought in him but finding a means to get them out of 
the darkened cell alive. Hurrying to Gorath, he freed him of his iron 
manacles and allowed the moredhel to lean against his shoulder as they 
limped together towards the heavy dungeon door. Again, tugging at the 
handle, they found that the lock was undone, another gift from their 
unknown benefactor.<p>

"What about the guard?" Owyn whispered, allowing Gorath to stand once 
more on his own.<p>

Gorath lifted his head and spoke, his speech still slurred by the drugs 
that had been administered to them. "Keep moving," he said, waving a 
hand at the door. "No one is there."<p>

Pushing out the door, they found themselves confronting a wide hallway 
with passages leading in three other directions...<p>

<blockquote>

Owyn shivered.<p>
Uncertain how long he and Gorath had spent in the darkness of the room beyond, each rendered 
helpless by the mind numbing drugs administered by Delekhan's assistants, he was in no hurry to 
return to the cages. "I think we already know what lies that way," he said to Gorath. "Let's try
another way."

DUNGEON: Exit Central Chamber without Weapons</b></font>
</td></tr></table>
</center>

<blockquote>

Gorath noticed the chests.<p>

Suddenly aware they were unarmed, he motioned to the containers.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
I think we should check the contents of those boxes before we leave this chamber. We may have 
need of weapons before we leave and I think it possible those storage boxes may contain items of
use to us.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
What if they're trapped?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
To what end? If Delekhan wished us dead, he has had ample opportunity to make us so with no 
advantage to keeping us alive. Have no doubt in you that Delekhan would have seen me dead at 
dawn...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
I've been thinking about that. Why wait? If you and Delekhan are the infamous enemies you claim 
to be, then I would think he'd have you hung at the gibbet immediately. There's no one left here
at Sar-Sargoth to put a show on for, because most of his supporters will be in the east getting 
ready for the attack. And why aren't there guards outside the cell?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Of that, perhaps I know something. Before Delekhan came to our cell, I heard the guards 
whispering that our captor, Narab, has escaped from Sar-Sargoth. If he has cause to escape,
then I must assume he and Delekhan have come to an end in their friendly alliance. If this is 
the case, then I must assume our watchers have been sent to find Nago. He would be a most 
dangerous creature to cross and could prove troublesome if he has decided against the Kingdom 
attack.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Perhaps this Narab fellow set us free. He might be looking for an ally.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Though Narab and I have no love for one another, there may be some truth in that speculation. 
His brother Nago was a sorcerer of no small skill, and it is possible he himself might have 
enough of the old talent to have opened your cell. And while in no way would he directly lend 
assistance to me, it is possible he hopes for some distraction in our escape while he maneuvers 
on his own.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Like letting the cattle out of the corral during a raid! The folk are so busy trying to round 
up their cows, they never know about the thieves slipping into their houses!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Something to that effect, yes. Now, let's have open those chests and see what we can find.<p>

Gorath halted at the stairwell.<p>
For a moment he narrowed his eyes as if he were intently listening, then turned to face his 
companion. "I should like to know your opinion," he said, his eyes lambent in the near darkness.
"It is possible that Delekhan has posted guards on the other side of this stairwell. If so, we 
may die even before we draw weapons."<p>
"We'll die if we don't go up as I see it," Owyn replied. "Die in a dungeon or die fighting for 
our lives. I'd at least like to think I was trying <i>something</i>."<p>
Gorath smiled. "At times you are not the boy you pretend to be. But still we have the decision.
Are you ready to make the ascent right now?"<p>

<font size=+1 color=#cc0000>
YES:</font><p>

The stairwell was unguarded.<p>
Breathing a sigh of relief, Owyn followed after his friend as they progressed down the 
corridors of the dungeon.

The stairwell spiralled downward.<p>
"Well," inquired Gorath. "Shall we?"<p>

YES:</font><p>

They descended noisily.<p>
Several times Owyn nearly lost his footing on the stone steps, but fortunately caught himself 
before sending them all tumbling down the stairwell. At last, they emerged into a large
corridor.

Gorath looked up the narrow stairwell.<p>
It was definitely a way up, but he questioned whether it was the right way for them to be going 
at the moment. "What do you think, Owyn?" he asked. "Feel like climbing all that way back up?"<p>

<font size=+1 color=#cc0000>
YES:</font><p>

They weren't observed.<p>
Thankful they had emerged from the dungeon alive, Gorath made a mental note to say a prayer of 
thankfulness to Ruthia once they were in safer circumstances. There still was the matter of 
escaping the outer perimeter of Sar-Sargoth to worry about...

</td><td valign=top>

Gorath stared at Owyn.<p>
"We've just escaped from the dungeons and you wish to <i>return</i> to them?" the moredhel asked.
"What are you thinking?"<p>
The boy shrugged. "It's your decision, Gorath. Do you want to go back down there?"<p>

<font size=+1 color=#cc0000>
YES:</font><p>

Gorath sighed.
Taking a chance the boy's instincts might be taking them the proper way, they descended once 
more into the darkness of Sar-Sargoth's dungeons...

Though a frosty wind skirled dust around the moredhel stronghold of Sar-Sargoth,

direction from the fortress, each graced with a decapitated head.

The man had the look of a mercenary.<p>
Unkempt and unshaven, he certainly was not hired with a group, for in larger 
companies the captains required discipline of self as well as discipline of 
sword, neither characteristics which seemed in evidence in the man's stubbled 
face. His eyes also seemed to reflect a vacant stupidity, a quality undesirable 
in any clan chief, but a positive boon for soldiers in the field.<p>
"Delekhan pays well," he said, swilling down the contents of the alecup in his 
grasp. "But I can't say I much care for his drinks. He needs to hire Keshians 
rather than Quegians if he wants to improve his stock."<p>

The man waved them over.<p>
Gorath made no hurry of approaching the man, taking time to make note of several 
things, not the least of which was that three different knife hilts protruded 
from under the man's leather belt. The man was a bounty hunter.<p>
"We appear to be of mutual interest," Gorath said.<p>
"You seem a little out of place," the man said, narrowing his gaze. "You'll not 
be traders because you didn't offer me a drink. It also seems unlikely you are 
mercenaries because you don't have their smell on you. So what is it then? 
Vagabonds , beggars...traitors?"<p>
Gorath smiled dangerously. "If you imagine a jingle in your pouch for claiming our 
heads, let me reassure you, you'll have only skulls for your efforts. There are 
no blood prices upon us, hunter. Of course, I wouldn't expect you to take us at 
our word."<p>
"Of course not," the man replied, returning the smile. "You won't mind that I 
ask a few of the other patrons here if they recognize your faces?"<p>
Gorath motioned to the bar. "Please, be our guest."

Gorath cleared his throat.<p>
Glancing up from the business of cleaning his fingernails with a bootknife, the

quickly make their business known.<p>
"<i>Scaba</i>," Gorath said, hoping his Quegian was up to par. "<i>Benuit tal regenus?</i>"<p>
The man smiled, showing uneven brown teeth. "<i>Pel niskum, seb michina chea</i>."<p>

you'll not be fighting at all," Owyn said, rapidly incanting.<p>
Immediately a brilliant flash filled the space between the two brawlers, hurling 
both back as thunder rumbled through the rafters, threatening to bring the roof 
down on their heads. Waggling his finger at them both, Owyn went off to look for 
something else to do.

Owyn took an emerald and carried it carefully to the stone slab. When he was still several steps 
away the gemstone began to feel very warm in his hand, and by the time he reached the slab the 
stone was crackling and shooting small sparks as from a piece of struck flint. It was all he 
could do not to drop it in the dust.<p>
Fighting the pain, which was growing in intensity with every inch, he jammed the emerald into 
the notch atop the stone. A blast of energy slammed him to the ground...<p>
Shielding their eyes from the flood of swirling light that was now emanating from the slab, they 
watched it gleam and pulse, heard it scream and shriek, felt it burn and electrify with blasts 
of energy greater than a lightning filled storm. It stopped as suddenly as it began, and still 
shaking they climbed to their feet, trying to regain their scrambled senses; blinking to see 
again, yawning to unplug their ears, stretching to soothe their aching bones.

eyes widened. Seeing Owyn they got even wider and he disappeared back into the house, just as 
his mother came forward.<p>

She had the child bring some fresh water, and after a few more words with Gorath, closed the

Gorath asked if they could enter and the moredhel reluctantly agreed. As he lead them into his

Shuffling inside, he explained his deformity to Gorath, "I followed Murmandamus into Kingdom

small moredhel joined them.<p>
"Well, my elusive friend," he said, I heard news you had been recaptured, but I see you have 
eluded Delekhan once again. And what of the rest of the Green Heart Clan?"<p>
Gorath stole a glance beyond the moredhel, into the tent, then spoke slowly, "Some fled, others 
have been pressed into service by Delekhan. And what of you, old friend? What is your story?"<p>
"I have no loyalties. My ship has always been steered by the Captain least likely to get me 
killed. Now, I stockpile supplies for the army that approaches."<p>
"You do not think Delekhan's plan to attack the Kingdom will get you killed? Just as your 
brothers were killed following Murmandamus?" Gorath shot back.<p>

other.<p>
"Have you found anything?" Gorath called.<p>

flashed in his head, and now remained there, burning in his memory, he walked to the northeast 
corner of the tent and began to dig. Gorath joined him and a few inches under the surface their 
fingers touched the wooden frame of a small box. Pulling the box from its earthy grave, Owyn 
looked inside.<p>

since fallen. Only a few scraps of rotting wood, and a square patch of earth around the 
perimeter of the tent gave notice of its former life.<p>
Gorath peeled back the flap of the tent and went inside, Owyn following closely behind.<p>
"A powerful spellcaster lived here once, long ago," said Gorath. "My brothers still come here 
on occasion..."<p>

the best way to test that is to drive them into Elvandar."<p>
Shortly the conversation drew to a close. Immediately, Gorath feared the arguing men might 
discover him listening at the door, but within he could hear no evidence they were moving to 
leave. Instead, after several minutes, he heard what sounded like a series of loud claps and 
then all became absolutely silent within.

A funereal pall hung over the broken stone walls of Armengar as a thick oily 
smoke rose from dark cracks in ground. Scavengers thrived in the ruins, living 
on the artifacts they found like mushrooms supping on the decayed bones of some 
old, dead thing. Slowly the moredhel would reclaim their city and restore its 
ancient name --- Sar-Isbandia.

Gorath investigated.<p>
Peering into the smoke filled hole, he was unable to see anything, although he 
was certain he smelled something like the burning of oil. For a long moment he 
stared in to the darkness before returning to his companion.<p>
"The fires still burn underground here," he said to Owyn. "Ten years ago past, 
when this fortress was attacked by Murmandamus, the man who held this ancient 
moredhel city set it ablaze rather than see the moredhel take it again."<p>
"Do you hate him for it?" Owyn asked, seeing Gorath's pained expression.<p>
The moredhel shook his head. "No. As much we should have done when Delekhan 
first raided in our villages."<p>

Gorath coughed.<p>
Nearly passing out from the intense fumes within the cavern, he was 
only able to take a few steps inside before the light was completely obscured by 
oily smoke. Still, there seemed to be a small hole dug in the wall of the cavern 
next to the entrance which he thought he could just reach.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
If my nose does not mislead, we must be nearing the naphtha caves of which 
Irmelyn spoke. It will be critical for you to cooperate with all that I say if 
we are to get Obkhar out of these caves alive.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Why are we even doing this? Why don't we simply head south?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Obkhar is a name familiar to me and I believe he may serve a purpose with his 
freedom. Kin to me in irritation, he has pricked Delekhan's ire times enough 
that we may depend he will avenge himself upon his captor.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
You're hoping that he's as much a bother to Delekhan as Narab then... So what 
will we need to do?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Venutrier of Lan operates in this locale and is known as a trader of slaves. I 
will offer you into slavery...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
You're going to what?!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Do not alarm yourself overmuch. Venutrier would have no need of a scrawny young 
boy in his naphtha caves and will undoubtedly insist I see his operations--- 
reassurance you will not be ill treated -- and when we have entered the caves, 
undoubtedly the both of us will be taken captive.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
This is your brilliant plan? We just got away from Delekhan in Sar-Sargoth and 
you want to get us taken captive again?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
We have a way out, however. As you may detect by the stench of this river that 
runs hard by, the naphtha mixes with it from and underground river which runs 
through the caves -- it has since the day Guy du Bas-Tyra torched Armengar. I 
know this because I have had words with others once held captive by Venutrier. 
Once we are ready to leave, we dive in the underground river and will emerge 
somewhere downstream.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
No one has ever died doing this?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
I have met none that have. Come, we have business to attend to.<p>

The tents were perfectly positioned for an army marching south from Sar-Sargoth toward the 
garrison at Highcastle. Gorath pulled back the flap and took a look inside the tent. "Owyn, I'll 
stand watch out here, you go inside and take a look around."<p>
Owyn did as instructed. He let his eyes adjust to the murky light inside the tent, then began a 
careful search.

Moving with great stealth, Owyn and Gorath approached the tent and peered inside. While it 
looked to be of moredhel origin, the few items they saw did not.<p>
"Nothing of real value in here," Gorath said quietly. "But this is definitely a goblin dwelling.
We must be very careful in this area."

There were shuffling sounds coming from inside the tent.<p>
Gorath approached cautiously, and was about to whisper something to Owyn when he suddenly 
stopped, his furrowed brows revealing a deep concern.<p>
Without warning, a large goblin lunged out of the tent, grabbing Gorath. Their violent struggle 
carried them back inside. Then, before Owyn could make a move to help, the conflict came to an 
end with a loud crunching snap!<p>
Rushing inside, Owyn found Gorath holding a lifeless goblin, its head twisted to the side at a 
very unnatural angle. The body dropped to the dirt floor with a dull thud.<p>
They searched the body and tent thoroughly, finding a small box in the corner with 25 gold 
sovereigns and a list of objects for sale. The list included naphtha and human slaves!

holding our breath while we're swimming out."<p>
"It is a long swim. If your breath should fail you before you surface, it is likely you would 
breathe in the naphtha. If you lost consciousness, your death would be assured, as would mine."

Owyn felt dizzy.<p>
His head spinning from the strong effects of the fumes within the cavern, he stared at the 
naphtha tainted water.<p>
"Are you prepared for the swim?" Gorath asked, "Or do you need to prepare for a bit?"<p>

<font color=#cc0000 size=+1>LEAVE:</font><p>

As he fit the vapor mask over his mouth and nose he studied the water before him, watched as it 
poured in a never ending stream into the rock cave where he knew it must, eventually, empty back
into the open air...and freedom.<p>
Breathing deeply through the mask, he felt his head finally clear and he dropped into the river,
Gorath splashing in beside him. The icy water was almost painful against his skin and he found it 
somewhat ironic the vapor mask had finally allowed him to breathe a little easier, but now the 
cold had taken that luxury away.<p>
Struggling against his pain he let the water carry him until he reached the dark mouth of the 
cave that would swallow him up as soon as he loosened his grip on the sides of the cavern.
With a deep breath, deep as he was capable of, he let go. The dark beast sucked him into its 
gullet and Owyn's world disappeared into total darkness...<p>

Owyn saw a dim light.<p>
It was hazy and without form but it quickly began to grow in intensity and definition, and 
rushing beside it -- pain. A dull throbbing pain in his head and limbs that hurt more with each 
beat of his heart...<p>
His eyelids flickered open and he could make out Gorath's form standing over him, though it was 
shrouded and somehow unreal, like a dream. But he knew it wasn't a dream, he knew he had 
survived his trip through the water cave, and with the realization he was alive he managed to 
whisper hoarsely, "If you EVER put us through that again, I will invent a cantrip whose sole 
purpose" he began to speak more rapidly and coherently, "is to cause you to fall desperately in 
love with a warthog -- may the two of you live happily ever after!"<p>
Gorath smiled, unusual for the normally sedate moredhel, water still dripping from his hair.
"I'm glad your sense of humor has returned. When you came up on the river banks and did not 
breathe, I was afraid you were lost."<p>
Owyn stood slowly and painfully. Gorath helped him with his pack and soon they were ready to 
leave.

steal secrets from the Six. He has told me where other soldiers are waiting in the hills. The 
Six told me I am to go and find if the boy is telling the truth..."<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>FINN:</font>
Boy, you're just about the luckiest whore's son I've ever laid eyes on. If we hadn't of heard 
the commotion down the pass, I think those goblins would have been having noble stew about now.
Nearly took out your friend here until I seen that he appeared to be fighting at your side. Now
I don't know what you think you're doing in the Northlands with these moredhel.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
It is very important that you take us to Prince Arutha.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>FINN:</font>
What?! The cold's gotten to you, boy. What makes you think I'm going to take time off from my 
duties and trot your behind down to Krondor?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Prince Arutha isn't in Krondor. He's likely still stationed with his Krondorian Lancers just
outside of the Dimwood near Sethanon. We need you to escort us to his camp.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>FINN:</font>
Why would he be there? And why would he want to see a boy and a moredhel?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
The Prince just sent us to spy on them, all right? They'd never suspect a scrawny nineteen year
old boy and a moredhel, so...that's why he sent us. We have information about a planned attack
on the Kingdom and it's vital we get this information to him.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>FINN:</font>
How do I know you're telling the truth?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
You don't, but if you don't take us and the moredhel overrun Northwarden, do you really think
you're going to be able to sleep with yourself?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>FINN:</font>
I have to give you one thing. If you're a gambler, you sure don't bid low... Come on, let' s 
get moving. The Dimwood's hell and back from here and the Prince won't want to be kept waiting.
Let's move.<p>

Just get us the hell out of here, Lieutenant. The sooner the better.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
...evaded capture and at last we were intercepted by your guards in the 
Inclindel Pass. The journey south to your camp here outside the Dimwood 
took many long days but we moved with great haste as our message is 
vital.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
Very interesting tale, but how do I know a word of it is true? How can 
I believe that this scroll you have given me is the genuine article and 
not a forgery trumped up by Delekhan?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
I was very explicit with you before, Gorath. I refuse to act until I 
have word from Seigneur James!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
He told us to give you a message, but it's...odd, sire.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
What exactly did he say?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
He said to tell you that there's a party at mother's...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
...and a good time will be had by all. Gods, Laurie and Jimmie used 
that phrase years ago! All's right then! James has just saved the pair 
of you your necks and me a good portion of grief.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
Now I must settle down to the matter of finding out what Delekhan is 
thinking. If this report is correct then the best force he could muster 
would number at the most two thousand warriors, a pitiful spit in the 
eye for a castle assault.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
You believe he has something else in mind.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
Undoubtedly. As James indicated in his brief note, it would take some 
spectacular strategy on Delekhan's part to take the castle, and 
honestly, he has never displayed that kind of wit. We faced him before 
when he was still a field captain for Murmandamus. Wherever he is going 
he will no doubt hit fast and run for high ground. Now we have to 
establish where that high ground is.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Shall we accompany you to Northwarden?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
No. I have a much more important task for you, though I doubt you will 
find it as exciting. I need you to return to Krondor immediately.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
Inform Master Magician Pug of the situation. Considering his tactics, I 
have a feeling Delekhan may have a few surprises in store for us. If 
that bastard brings anything magical to bear, I want to know what it is 
and how to counteract it.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
You leave immediately.<p>
