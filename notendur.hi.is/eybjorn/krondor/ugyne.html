Lacking the arrogant bearing of her father, she moved like a wisp of smoke, her tread so light

You are so much taller than I remember! You've gone and grown up on me, haven't you?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>UGYNE:</font>
I can't remain a little girl all my life, cousin. Father would have me married to some Vicompte 
somewhere spinning tapestries if he had his way but I'm a little too headstrong for the liking 
of most of my suitors. You know I've always hoped you would come up and sweep me off to some 
strange place.<p>

Third son of a very minor Count? I don't think your father would stand for it. Besides, I still 
can't conscience any girl that likes barrel ball tourneys.<p>

Pig. Are you going to introduce me to your rather handsome friends here, or shall I perish of

Perhaps later, if I'm feeling up to it...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Not such a bad prospect. I've always liked this part of the country.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>UGYNE:</font>
You would. Anything to get away from that tyrant of a father of yours. He never allowed us to 
have any fun at all. Always so serious about everything.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
And I suppose you think your father was any the better about rearing children?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>UGYNE:</font>
Hmm, well, so both our fathers are wretched bores. I suppose that's why we're so much alike...<p>
Now, why have you come a pestering a young girl out enjoying the afternoon?<p>

So, when is a suitor going to snatch you up? Are there any that are even in good standing?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>UGYNE:</font>
There are two, neither of whom father likes, but then again he never likes anyone I do. One is 
Myron, my father's solicitor who lives just outside of Cavall Keep with his daughter Ami. He 
does have a minor claim to nobility because his brother is an Earl someplace, but father thinks 
his connections are too tenuous for us to consider.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
And what about the second suitor?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>UGYNE:</font>
He's a businessman from Kenting Rush named Navon du Sandau. I like him, though he can be a bit 
intense at times. We like to talk and he is always asking me some point about mythology or 
another. He doesn't mind a girl who reads.<p>

What are you doing wandering around unescorted? Honestly, you astonish me. By your age, most

<font color=#ffcc00>UGYNE:</font>
How's that for an introduction?! You're only four years older than me, Owyn and I don't see that
my age has anything to do with it. I just like to come out here to think when I have a problem 
that won't solve itself otherwise. It also gives me a safe harbor away from father when he's on 
one of his raging fits.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Is he on one at the moment?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>UGYNE:</font>
One of the worst I've ever seen. He's fired the entire kitchen staff, dismissed the guard, 
thrown out all five of my maids. He's been that way since about dinner time last evening. I 
tried to ask him what had him so upset, but he would only tell me that he had received some 
very bad news from a messenger regarding a financial arrangement which he had made.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Have any idea what the note said?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>UGYNE:</font>
Who knows? He's always on about conspiracy this, conspiracy that. It's like he's always afraid 
someone's about to find out some dire secret about the family when there's nothing to hide.
It's getting terribly repetitive really... So...you have this frightful look on your face as if 
there's something you're afraid to speak to me about. What is it?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
You'll forgive us if we look a little ragged, but we're trying to find out about a murder that 
took place down in Romney. We've been searching for a little while.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>UGYNE:</font>
Do you think the murderer escaped to Cavall Keep?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
We're not sure. All we know at the moment is it may have had something to do with a brass 
spyglass or a silver spider we found near the bodies.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>UGYNE:</font>
I don't suppose the spyglass had a star inscribed on it, did it?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
I can't recall. Why? Would that be important?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>UGYNE:</font>
For someone who's a part of the family, you certainly don't seem to know much about the family 
lore... We used to have a spyglass that sat in a glass case in the entry way of the Keep. There 
was a legend that if a person knew the right things to think, then they could use the spyglass 
to spy on the minds of others. It was in the family for generations, but it disappeared about 
the time that Neville was killed in the wine cellar all those years ago. Father accused the 
workmen of having stolen it.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
And what things was the person to think to make the spyglass work?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>UGYNE:</font>
I don't know. Neville used to tease me and told me he knew what to think and that he could use 
it, but he never did. It was only a legend, after all.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Your father says he doesn't like your suitor Navon because he keeps bringing up painful memories
about the Keep when he asks about the family legends. The death of your mother, the fire that 
burned the Keep down...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>UGYNE:</font>
It isn't fair to hold that against Navon. He is interested in our family, in me, and so 
naturally he has questions about the Keep. Wouldn't you be interested in the history of 
someone you wish to marry? Wouldn't you want to know them as well as you know your own family?
It's not so much the death of my mother that bothers father, though, as does Neville's death 
all those years ago. But father insists on clinging to a silly coincidence.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Coincidence? What's a coincidence?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>UGYNE:</font>
Navon's last name is du Sandau. It's the same last name as the man who constructed father's 
wine cellar, the one that collapsed. Father's holding it against him that he happens to have 
the same last name! It's so...ridiculous.<p>

I don't remember much about how Neville died. It was such a long time ago...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>UGYNE:</font>
You couldn't have known much about it so far off in Tiburn. Mother and father were both in such 
grief, they didn't want a spectacle made of his death. Neville was down in Cavall Run, sent down
by father to get a keg of Quegian Sour from his wine cellar. We had guests that day...<p>

Cavall Run?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>UGYNE:</font>
You remember... Underneath the Keep? All those tunnels that seemed to stretch for miles? We 
never did know for sure how extensive it was. I used to love to take walks down there in the 
dark, just to think and have some time to myself. It's one of the things I miss most about
the Keep, not having the tunnels to play in anymore.<p>

When Neville didn't come back from getting the keg, father went down into the Run after him.
The wine was served, then the appetizers, then the first course, still father hadn't come back. 
The second course was served, the third, and then finally father appeared. He told us the tunnel
had collapsed and Neville was trapped behind it all. We were never able to dig it out enough to 
recover the body...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
What does the Guarda Revanche have to do with our family history? I thought it was some kind of 
legend about the days when only the elves lived here.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>UGYNE:</font>
The part of the legend that everybody knows has to do with the elves, but for a time the Guarda 
Revanche was in our family's possession, or so family legend has it.<p>

Upon her fourteenth birthday, the Lady of Cavall Keep was given a special present by her elven 
servant to give her husband, Lord Corvalis, a sword that would make him great among men.
Whereupon she ran to his bedchamber to present him with the great gift, but upon opening the 
door she was shaken by a great evil. Within her hand, the sword blade began to glow and she 
screamed as she raised the blade over her head and cleaved her husband's head from off his 
shoulders. From there, she went from one child's chamber to the next until she had slain all 
her children by Lord Corvalis and once that was done, she ran mad and was seen in Cavall no more.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
How charming. You don't have it laying about somewhere do you?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>UGYNE:</font>
Be nice to me or I may give the sword to you! No, the legend goes on to say that it was 
eventually removed from the family after the episode was repeated by later generations of other 
branches of our family. A book I have about it tells where it went, but I lent the book to 
Navon so he could look it over.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
That's weird. I thought that the Guarda Revanche was only supposed to work on moredhel...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>UGYNE:</font>
It's a legend. No one ever said that a legend has to be consistent!<p>
