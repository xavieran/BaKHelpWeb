You should know that there are not many things that anger me. But as I feel, I never have been 
angry until this very moment!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
If I have given you offense...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GABOT:</font>
Offense?! Every day my men ride to the border of the Northlands to hold back Delekhan's obscene 
dogs, every day they thrust their lives into the breech to buy another day of the Kingdom's 
freedom! These mountain tops are littered with the bodies of men who have given their lives in 
that cause and you spit on their graves by bringing a moredhel into my castle! I should hang you
from the bailey!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
He has cause to be here. Prince Arutha believes this moredhel may have information that can 
lead us to the Nighthawks...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GABOT:</font>
Damn Prince Arutha! He has no conception of what the moredhel are like and the fact that he has 
taken this moredhel's word proves it. Seigneur Locklear told me the story about this moredhel 
and I no more believe in his virtue than I believe in Delekhan's strength!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Baron, I have a duty to perform and if in the name of that duty I must offend a Baron then so be
it! As I have had cause to come to this place, I need a few answers and I sincerely believe it 
would benefit the both of us to help one another. If you choose to block me, then I am sure that
Prince Arutha would be more than happy to inform King Lyam that one of his subjects has deemed 
himself above imperial courtesy!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GABOT:</font>
Seigneur, as a border baron I owe fealty to King Lyam and he alone! What Prince Arutha may or 
may not do is his own affair. But if by answering your questions I may be shod of you all the 
more quickly, I am at your disposal! What do you want?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GABOT:</font>
I am glad to see you once more. I am sorry about my earlier behavior. Just previous to your 
arrival, I was informed that a few of my men were killed and the issue was still on my mind. 
Please let me know however I may be of assistance.<p>

Sounds marvelous. When do I start?<p>

Lieutenant Aaron! I have a new recruit I would like for you to assign...<p>

It was late.<p>

Breathing warmth into his cupped hands, James paced the frost-touched flagstones between the 
postern and bailey gates and looked out into the darkness beyond the castle. Nothing was moving 
in the mists. Like the world within the gates, things seemed orderly in the extreme. Too orderly.<p>
Even in Krondor, the Prince's control was far from complete with the Upright Man running matters
in the sewers and scoundrels of various stripes calling the shots in the poorer quarters. Here, 
it was as if the world outside Northwarden simply did not exist in any other context than how 
Baron Gabot dictated it to his men. It would be entirely too easy for an outside force to take 
advantage of the rigor with which he ruled his men.<p>

"It's time Jimmy the Hand did a little something off schedule," James muttered, scaling the 
bailey wall with little trouble. Settling himself in a patch of shadow, he focused his eyes on 
the courtyard below and folded his arms across his chest. Now it was time for the real guard 
duty...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GABOT:</font>
I would be most interested to know why you felt it necessary to have me awakened in the middle 
of the night.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
It would have been preferable if you had come when I called. Your guard shifts are utterly 
inadequate, Baron. Last night, while I was on guard duty, I decided to vary the schedule a bit 
and see what happened. When I watched the bailey gate when I was to be on the other side of the 
castle, I noticed a soldier slipping a note to another man who was waiting outside the castle 
gate. A few minutes later, when I shifted to the opposite side, again I saw another instance of 
someone attempting to steal a griefmaker from the castle armory. I stopped him, naturally. There
were several other instances.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GABOT:</font>
And the note passed through the bailey gate?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Harmless. A love letter from a soldier quartered here named Corbi to a girl named Thea... You've 
become too regimented here. Your schedules are known outside the castle, very likely made known 
by a spy working within these very walls. I urge you to take greater precautions and to 
reevaluate your staff. It could be the downfall of this castle.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GABOT:</font>
I shall...consider it... In the meantime, I ask you accept something as a token of gratitude. 
There is a suit of Euliliko Armor that I no longer have a need for. You may have it if you wish.
It makes no difference to me.<p>

Seigneur, I would talk with you but I am not entirely comfortable with the moredhel's presence. 
If he could step out of the room?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
I will be waiting in the antechamber.<p> 

<font color=#ffcc00>GABOT:</font>
This will take but a few moments... James, what do you know about the experimental projects that
we have going on here at Northwarden?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Very little. I believe the Prince mentioned you had discovered an explosive powder similar to 
naphtha but I don't know much beyond that.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GABOT:</font>
Our powder is similar to naphtha, yes, but many times stronger. With a portion that would 
scarcely fill my hand, we can rain two hundred pound iron balls onto enemy forces. It would 
destroy anything it hit. Unfortunately it takes a team of ten men a half hour to re-load the 
weapon and as yet its accuracy is not such that I would wish to count upon it in battle. In 
many years, it is possible it will be a weapon of monstrous power, but we will first have to 
learn how to master it...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
It will be a great contribution to the Kingdom's arsenal.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GABOT:</font>
Yes, and it would be an even greater contribution to Delekhan. What I haven't told you is that 
thirty of Northwarden's pigs have been stolen over the past six months.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Pigs?... I don't understand, what do missing pigs have to do with anything?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GABOT:</font>
Pig urine is a principle component in the formulation of the powder and our swine can't survive 
the Northland cold. If someone in the castle has leaked the formula to them, they may well be 
attempting to build up stock for their own experiments.<p>

ENEMY ACTIVITY</font>

<blockquote>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
What has the enemy activity in the region been like? Any signs of increase?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GABOT:</font>
We can, at least, substantiate Prince Arutha's fears that the moredhel plan to attack. A few of 
my scouts slipped into Raglam and discovered a catapult and several siege engines under 
construction. Any number of Quegian mercenaries have already arrived in town, though none yet 
know where they are being sent. It seems that the native moredhel have adapted an attitude of 
wait and see how the battle is going before committing to Delekhan's strike force.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Gorath told us as much. The run against Sethanon apparently left a bad taste in the mouths of 
the moredhel clans and this Delekhan doesn't have Murmandamus' silver tongue. He's had to bully 
several of the clans into joining him, though a few of the larger clans have sworn to withhold 
their support until Delekhan proves himself.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GABOT:</font>
I am not so much concerned about the Quegians in the battle as I am the possibility the moredhel
may cook up something unexpected. There is talk Delekhan has a circle of advisers known as The 
Six, magicians of some order. I don't relish the thought of running up against some of the 
tricks that Murmandamus pulled during the battle that destroyed Armengar. Duke Martin has been 
telling me about it, though I understand he was absent before the final assault began.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Duke Martin is here?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GABOT:</font>
He arrived on a social visit shortly before your friend. I was the Huntsmaster of Carse when he 
was still working for the Duke of Crydee and he recommended me to this post following Baron 
Rossol's death. When your friend arrived from Krondor with news of another possible attack, he 
decided to stay and help however he could here until Prince Arutha advises him further. Right 
now he and Seigneur Locklear are leading a small scouting expedition into the high hills.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
So what about this magic problem? Are you going to hire any magicians?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GABOT:</font>
Long ago, I saw the wisdom that Duke Borric displayed in having Kulgan and Pug in his duchy. It 
was one of the first things I did once I assumed command here. Since he felt uncomfortable here 
for some reason, Patrus is off working on a few tricks of his own to counter any moredhel 
spellcraft.<p>

It seems our time for preparations is at an end. Two of my field captains were found dead in 
areas through which a moredhel strike force would likely come. That leaves me with one garrison 
company and two field companies operating under green commanders. That does not make for an 
advantage in a siege.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
What of Duke Martin? I know he was visiting here.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GABOT:</font>
He already is in the field with my rangers. I want you two to work with him to find ways to 
slow down or stop the oncoming enemy companies. Our scouts have estimated the moredhel have 
fielded about fifteen hundred men.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
You have three hundred men here and a castle! It's far more than you need to stop that many 
soldiers.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GABOT:</font>
If there are Nighthawks that have infiltrated my troops, we will likely lose more than field 
captains before this is all over. We have to assume for the moment that the moredhel know 
something that we don't. If we can stop even half their number, I imagine we can diffuse 
whatever plan it is they have. So, any questions before you begin?<p>

Where can we find Duke Martin? Is he in the castle somewhere?<p>

I asked him to stay relatively close to the castle so my guards could find him in the instance 
of an emergency. You will have to search for him yourself. While you are at it, perhaps you can 
also find what has become of our minstrel, Tamney.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
He may have quit the castle. Minstrels are not noted for their staying power through great 
battles.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GABOT:</font>
It will work against the morale of the men should he remain absent. I want you to find him and 
use whatever means you have at your disposal to bring him back here, even if you bring him back
