THE CHAPTER BEGINS<br>
</font>
</center>

<blockquote>

James' breath emerged from his lips as a frosty white cloud.<p>

Below him, Seigneur Locklear negotiated scrub brush as he worked his 
way up the winding mountain path. He cursed expansively as a thorn bush 
caught in the chinks of his leg guards and he paused to throw his 
friend an exasperated frown. James smiled, then turned to look out over 
the snowy peaks that marked the boundary of moredhel territory.<p>

Five hours after arriving at Northwarden, Baron Gabot had called both 
he and Locklear into his meeting room. While worried about James' story 
of Nighthawks, he was far more concerned that his magical adviser had 
not reported back from investigating possible moredhel activity. With a 
large band of the Dark Brothers approaching his castle, he feared that 
the old magician might have fallen into enemy hands, and so, 
reluctantly, he had asked the two Seigneurs to finish Patrus' job.<p>

Locklear arrived puffing, his face haloed by mist.<p>

"I thought I was going to have to come down there and carry you up," 
James said grinning. "You shouldn't have stayed up all night with that 
serving girl."<p>

"I didn't expect to have to get up at the crack of dawn," Locklear 
growled, yanking a twig from his chain mail. "Mountain climbing and 
armor do not mix."<p> 

Suddenly, the two Seigneurs wheeled to the sound of a horrible 
mewling...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PATRUS:</font>
...And if it weren't bad enough I had to chase you, you made me get 
rocks in my best shoes! I'm blistered! Know how mad I get when my feet 
hurt? I get river bottom mud sucking badger whacked mad...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Excuse us...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PATRUS:</font>
Go way. I'm busy right now agitatin' this here moredhel...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Begging your pardon, but I am Seigneur James...and this...and this 
is...Seigneur Locklear. We have been sent...by the Baron Gabot...to 
find...you. You are his magical advisor, aren't you?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PATRUS:</font>
Just Patrus, please. I don't ken to titles much. Glad to meet you. I've 
just been out trying to get some information about these moredhel. 
They've been gettin' too close to the castle and it was makin' my 
tongue itch. Man can't respectably eat thataways.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Have you...learned anything about the attack?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PATRUS:</font>
Only that there's six companies of 'em out creepin' in the woods 
somewhere, but I don't know exactly where yet. I think they've got their 
own magicians, too.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Magicians?! The Baron will be sorry to hear that, I'll wager. We need 
to return to the castle. Which way would be quickest?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PATRUS:</font>
Northwarden? Oh, well it's THATAWAY...<p>

The man invited them to talk.<p>
A quiet, amiable fellow who was missing three of the fingers of his left hand, he smiled as 
James and Locklear told some of the stories about their childhood together in Krondor. When at 
last they began a story about the minstrel Laurie who had become the Duke of Salador, the man 
nodded, but interrupted them when they claimed he was the best minstrel that ever lived.<p>
"I imagine this Duke of yours was quite talented," the man said. "But a short while ago, a
<i>jongleur</i> played here, the match of which I've never heard."<p>
Immediately Locklear and James exchanged a meaningful look, then looked back to the man. "What 
did this minstrel look like?" James asked.<p>
"Young, attractive. Rather tall as I recall," the man said. "Have you seen him before?"<p>
James nodded. "If it's who I'm thinking, then yes. Do you happen to know what became of him?"<p>
"Not certain, but he was asking about for a place to put down for the night. One of the other 
patrons that was in here told him that a franklin nearby sometimes leaves his barn open for 
travellers. He might have gone there."<p>
Making a mental note of all the man had said, James began to rise from the table when the man 
tugged at his sleeve. "Another thing, the man told him that the door to the barn sticks quite 
a bit and that he might not be able to get the door open. Takes quite a strong man to get it to 
work sometimes."<p>
"I'll keep that in mind," James said. "Have a good day."

</td><td valign=top>
<b>

James remembered the man.<p>
Smiling warmly at them, the man asked how their search for the missing minstrel was going. "Have 
you found him yet?"<p>
"No," James replied with a sigh. "I was hoping you might have some more insight on the issue."<p>
The man shrugged. "I'm not sure I know much to help you with. All I know is that he headed 
towards the old barn with the sticking door. That happens quite a bit up in these climates."<p>
"What do you mean?" James asked.<p>
"Its all the rain," the man said, motioning at the roof. "Warps the doors and rusts the hinges.
Half the farmers in these parts have to keep a supply of Fadamor's Formula handy just so they 
can get at their cows in the mornings."<p>
"Didn't know that," James replied. "Ah well, I'll leave you to your drink. We've got to be 
searching some more."<p>
"Good day to you then," the man said with a nod. "Hope you find him."

Locklear felt a stinging poke.<p>
"Ouch!" he cried out, looking for the insect responsible for his discomfort. Finding none, he 
turned to a puzzled Patrus to explain his outburst. But before the words could come out of his 
mouth, Patrus felt a bite...<p>
"What is this place?" cried the magician, feeling still another sting.<p>
"I don't know," said James. "But I suggest we leave here -- hmmph -- at once."

</td><td valign=top>

Patrus stopped.<p>
James took a few more steps before he realized the magician wasn't with him and turned to find 
him staring off into the bushes with a comical, questioning look.<p>
"Somethin' ain't right about things here..." Patrus said, turning in a slow circle. "Ain't what 
they appears to be <i>at all</i>. An if'n a thing ain't what it looks like, that means it's 
wearin' some kind o' mask."<p>
"What are you babbling on about?" Locklear asked.<p>
"The invisible magicians, you donkey!" Patrus shot back. Almost imperceptibly, his mouth began 
to move. Silently forming words long forgotten, his lips began to move faster, in sync with a 
secret accelerating rhythm only he could know. Then he gave voice to the words and they tumbled 
from his throat, louder and louder until he was nearly shouting.<p>
James saw a strange shimmering in the air. He turned to look and before his amazed eyes saw a 
huddled pack of moredhel spellcasters!

A band of goblins milled in the roadway.<p>
James stared hard at the leader of the goblin band that faced them. At his side, Locklear 
counted heads, silently calculating the combined worth of the mercenary force.<p>
"What do you think, Locky?" James muttered.<p>
"Whatever Delekhan's game is, he's <i>paying</i> for it," Locklear replied grimly. "Goblin 
mercenaries charge small fortunes for their services and by my guess, there's at least...a 
thousand sovereigns worth of them here. I don't think they'll attack us unless they think we're 
getting too close. We <i>might</i> be able to negotiate a passage price..."<p>
"Pah," Patrus spat. "Dark Brothers are Dark Brothers. They're just mean spirited, period."<p>
Stepping out of the ranks of the enemy, a tall pale complected goblin drew his sword and pointed
it at James. Speaking the Kingdom tongue with some difficulty, he glared at them with black eyes.
"You speak price of passage," he said. "Deirgun hear speaking of you and tell to Gulla. Gulla 
consider and say price of passing is being thousands of two sovereigns."<p>
"Thousands of two?" James repeated. "You mean two thousand sovereigns?"<p>
Gulla nodded. "If you pay, we shall let you pass. If you come closer and not pay we kill you. 
You give us thousands of two?"

CATAPULT - FIRST INSPECTION</b></font>

<blockquote>

The design was standard.<br>
James examined the catapult with great interest, noting it was remarkably 
similar to the models used in the Kingdom. On many occasions he had seen rocks 
in excess of fifty pounds thrown twice the length of a barrel ball court with 
such a device.<p>

Locklear gaped in wonderment at the heavy wooden catapult.<br>
They walked around the weapon and studied it from every angle, spending extra time looking at 
the firing and trigger mechanisms. On the whole it appeared to be in good condition, though one 
of the torsion gears had broken.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PATRUS:</font>
Moredhel must'a built this toad throwin' toy to annoy the Baron. They'd never get it up the 
pass 'fore old grump buckets shot 'em down!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Perhaps, but it's of no use to them now unless someone fixed it in order to lob stones at
<i>Raglam</i>.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Now, <i>that's</i> peculiar now that you mention it. Tell me Locky, if you were just going to 
leave something like this lying around in a field, even if you didn't have it working, would 
you leave it pointed at your home?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
What are you getting at?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
The only reason this thing won't function is because one of the torsion gears is broken, not 
something all that complicated to fix. Now suppose the gear didn't break of its own accord.
Gorath told me that many of the moredhel clans had reservations about fighting under the old 
battle colors of Murmandamus. Now if you were one of those clans and wanted a backup plan in 
case you wanted to back out of the strike, it would simply be a matter of installing a 
replacement gear...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
...and pulling the release lever! It even has a payload in the basket! Of course, assuming we 
could find the part ourselves, we could stir up some trouble. Maybe find a way to get to the 
plans Duke Martin needs in the confusion.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Perhaps, but we'll need to find a replacement catapult part first. I doubt there is one lying 
about here somewhere, but let's check around...<p>

They searched the area for half an hour, hoping to discover a replacement part for the broken 
gear. When it didn't materialize, they picked up their packs and prepared to leave.<p>

Holding the catapult part they had found in the box, and using some makeshift tools he kneeled 
before the machine and set to work...<p>
It took nearly two hours to install the part, and though Locklear wasn't positive the machine 
would work at all, he stepped back to admire his handiwork.<p>
"I'm not an engineer, but I think that should work," he said, motioning to the others to join 
him. Together, they stood before the strange wooden creature, it's one arm poised, ready to 
fling its special cargo into the sleepy moredhel town of Raglam.<p>
Locklear took a deep breath. "Shall we give it a try?" he asked.

It was a marvel of moredhel engineering and though short on artistic value -- something that

craftsmanship.<p>

An old moredhel answered their call. Despite the unusual group he found before him, he allowed 
them into his tent.<p>
He spoke to them in the Kingdom tongue. "Were things you wear taken by combat? Or do they 
represent true loyalties?"<p>
Locklear spoke quickly, "We are from the Kingdom, but we bow down before only two powers: gold 
and silver."<p>
The moredhel was either satisfied with this answer, or he was too tired to care. He motioned for 
them to sit down. After a short conversation, they found out that he had come to Raglam to die. 
Too old to travel with the rest of his clan, and not willing to stay alone in Raglam, he had 
resolved to wander off into the forest and let his life slip away like the wind in the trees.
Though he hated the moredhel race, the conversation made Patrus sort of sad. He was glad when
they left.

There was a bedroll on the floor and some rations in a small chest. Something on the wall of the

The moredhel approached them.<p>
Apparently satisfied with their story about being mercenaries from Queg, the moredhel told them 
he was a trader who made frequent trips to several of the towns located near the border between 
the Kingdom and the Northlands, explaining his command of their language.<p>
"What can you tell of the push south?" asked James.<p>
"Word has it that Captain Kroldech received his final orders for the move against Northwarden. 
Futile. With our numbers, we have no hope of surviving the march to it and then breaching the 
walls. This Kingdom baron will crush us utterly unless the engineer has come up with something."<p>
Trying not to be too interested, James prodded the moredhel further. "Segersen?"<p>
The moredhel stared at them strangely. "I had heard he was killed in a Quegian battle near 
Palanque."<p>
"I wouldn't know," James recovered casually. "I've not been on foot for eight years or more.
I've been working in a press gang."<p>
"Mmm," the moredhel replied. "Well, it's all a moot point at the moment anyway. Kroldech has 
locked himself into his commandeered command post to work on the battle plans for a goblin 
offensive and the engineer just sits in his house drawing up design. Hopefully the Kingdom 
won't elect to retaliate after this madness is over with."<p>
They thanked him for the information he was able to provide and casually strolled back to a 
spot near the tavern door.

As Patrus picked up the lute and began to play, he was amazed by the huge assortment of gears,
pulleys, springs and other equipment that were scattered around the house. The moredhel was 
obviously some sort of engineer.<p>
"What is all this stuff?" whispered Locklear.<p>
"I cannot be sure but I recall stories of a moredhel weapon maker whose ideas and plans were 
sometimes too <i>inspired</i>, even for Delekhan. He was known to be a bit of a musician, though 
not a good one, and he used to demand musicians play for him while he worked. Only they couldn't 
play better than he or --"<p>
"STOP THAT RACKET! This isn't music you play! I could make better music dropping that instrument 
down a flight of stairs! GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!"<p>
Not wanting to upset him any further they agreed to leave. As they stepped out the door, Patrus 
whispered, "I tried not to play my best, but playing poorly can sometimes be as difficult as 
playing well..."

</td><td valign=top>

Patrus played poorly.<p>
Considering his condition, this was a pretty easy task. Fortunately, this is exactly what the 
old moredhel wanted to hear. He grumbled something about being able to "play better," and this 
seemed to make him happy; soon he was telling them all about his work.<p>
"I <i>had</i> been working on a catapult for Captain Kroldech, but the dragon lover refused to 
pay me when I was finished with it. So I fixed him right up...removed a critical gear and now he 
can't get it to work at all."<p>
The moredhel laughed, then continued with a sly smile. "I finally had it moved to a spot within 
range of his house, and loaded it up with a magical poison. One of these days I'm going to 
retrieve that gear and you can say goodbye to Captain Kroldech then, I can assure you."<p>
"Where did you hide this gear?" inquired James innocently.<p>
"Hid it in a box by the bridge. Now shut up and let me concentrate."<p>
Despite the poor quality of the music being played, it seemed to have a soothing effect on the 
old moredhel, because before long they heard a soft clunk, and looking up they realized it was 
the sound of his head dropping onto the wooden table.<p>
Moving quietly so as not to disturb him, they left.

Locklear hesitated before the door.<p>
"Kroldech," he snarled, rubbing his finger across three red marks above the door frame.<p>
"What does that mean?" asked James.<p>
"Captain Kroldech. He is a moredhel leader who has a reputation for setting up residence in
<i>empty</i> dwellings."<p>
"What are the three red marks over the door?"<p>
"Those are equal in number to the original inhabitants he murdered to ensure the emptiness of 
the structure. The rumors of his savagery have spread as far south as Krondor."<p>
Fearing an exchange would draw unwanted attention from other moredhel nearby, and realizing the 
futility of a confrontation they left.

The door was ajar.<p>
James tried to enter the small house, but something seemed to be blocking the door. He pushed a 
little harder and reluctantly the door swung open a little further. Peering into the darkened 
room they could make out the form of a male moredhel on the floor. Kroldech's body was curled 
into a fetal position and he appeared to be clutching at his throat.<p>
"The engineer knew his business quite well," he said. "That catapult load seems to have been 
very effective. Search the room, quickly."<p>
After several minutes of intense examination Locklear called out, "I think I've found something."<p>
Behind a wooden writing desk in the corner was a Sword of Lims-Kragma, a small pouch with 150 
gold coins, and a set of company orders. This would put a kink in the moredhel attack plans!

The portcullis creaked.<p>

An ashen faced soldier trembled as he labored at the monolithic peg 
wheel, his back arched backwards taut as a bowstring as he hauled the 
iron gate upwards. With a jerk of his neck, he gasped between clenched 
teeth for James and his companions to hurry inside.<p>

Within, a handful of soldiers hurried to various tasks on the 
battlements and panicked captains attempted to rally the surviving 
contingents of the day's fighting.<p>

"Something's wrong," James muttered, observing the disarray. "What's 
happened?"<p>

"Baron Gabot's been murdered, that's what's happened!" a nearby soldier 
shouted, glancing up from where he worked feverishly at unplugging a 
keg of oil. "We found a bloody nest of Nighthawks in our midst! They 
murdered the Baron's staff and three of the captains before we cornered 
'em in a storeroom."<p> 

"Torch those corpses immediately," James ordered. "They might be Black 
Slayers. Where is Duke Martin?"<p>

"Don't know. You're the closest thing we have to nobility at the 
moment. Guess that puts you in command, Seigneur.<p>

James said nothing as a rumble of thunder split the sky.<p>

Half dead soldiers trumped past, their eyes hollowed with exhaustion as 
they traded places with equally worn men brought from the
dining hall-turned-infirmary. Few men still possessed clothing unstained by blood.<p>

Dour with the turn of events, James eyed the horizon for any sign of 
help. In all likelihood, the moredhel would attempt to breach the wall 
today and there was little he could do about it. Nighthawk treachery 
had silenced their cannons and too many men had fallen in four days of 
heavy fighting.<p>

"Attack!" a voice screamed in the stillness. "Attack! Men on the south 
face!"<p>

James cast a fuming curse into the sunrise. He might die, but he would 
send as many moredhel as he could reach in to the halls of the Death 
Goddess before he would go down...<p>

The moredhel thrashed.<p>

As life dimmed in his horrified eyes he toppled backwards into a wooden 
balustrade. With an ear splitting shriek the railing sundered into 
flying splinters, tumbled after his flailing feet as he disappeared 
into nothingness.<p>

Almost too dazed to breathe, James bolted to the wall to sight his 
fallen opponent. A crumpled heap of armor lay far below, splashed in 
gore and a spreading stain of red. Close by, a grim looking figure 
lowered his crossbow and tilted up his shaggy dark head to favor the 
Seigneur with a rare smile.<p>

Arutha!<p>

Delekhan would think me impolite if I didn't attend his little party. 
How are the men?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Very bad. Of the original garrison of four hundred and fifteen men, two 
hundred twenty seven are dead, thirty five are mortally wounded, and 
the rest are afflicted with dysentery or are too exhausted to wield a 
sword. Your arrival came none too soon.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
No discourtesy intended, Prince, but why did you wait so long in 
coming?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
We made all haste, nearly to the point of calamity! Your well-meaning 
messengers bumped into trouble and nearly didn't win themselves free. 
Consequently we didn't receive your word until it was nearly too late 
for us to respond. We were greatly fortunate to arrive as soon as we 
did.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
The moredhel are in retreat?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
What few of them remain. By the accounts of my scouts, they think there 
may have been up to at least six companies in the hills.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
About that. Since they didn't have the decency to attack all at once, 
we couldn't tell.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
If our trackers are to be believed, four of those companies slipped out 
a week ago while the other two kept your forces pinned down. The rest 
apparently turned southwest.<p> 

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Sounds like they mean to strike at Highcastle.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
Undoubtedly. Since the moredhel leader has mimicked many of the moves 
that his predecessor Murmandamus made, it stands to reason he may make 
many of the same mistakes.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
As a precaution, I split my forces and diverted half of them to 
Highcastle. As soon as we are finished cleaning up here, I will take 
the rest of our companies to engage him there.<p>
