The way ahead was blocked.<p>

From among the men who were guarding the bridge, a man stepped forward to confront them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
I wouldn't advise venturing any closer to Romney. She' s a city besieged.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
What's happened here?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
Guild war, uprising, chaos, the whole of Romney's lost its senses. I'm surprised you haven't 
heard, but then again, a child scraping his knee in Romney seems more important here than does 
a coronation in Rillanon. It all started when the Guild of the Riverpullers was pushed out of 
Silden by a splinter guild, the Guild of the Romney. When the Riverpullers tried to recoup their
losses by raising fees in Romney, the Glazer's and Dyer's Guilds refused to take the brunt and 
we contracted the splinter guild to bring in goods. Unfortunately the Riverpullers asserted 
they had royal grant of exclusivity to the river and burned two Romney Guild rafts. Three 
members of the Glazer's Guild were killed in the fire as was the chief reeve of the Dyer's 
Guild. We've been fighting for access to Romney ever since.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Who seems to have the upper hand at the moment?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
Neither side. It's a stalemate with the labor guilds occupying the North bank of the Ursine 
Ford and the crafters on the South. I was trapped on this side before the Riverpullers ordered 
the blockade. Oh, and by the way, I'm Mitchel Waylander, Local Chief Reeve of the Glazer's Guild.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Nice to meet you. What do you think it's going to take to bring this fight to an end?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
We've sat down to negotiate with them, but the Riverpullers' leader is a hard old crat and 
frankly, I don't think he wants to end it. They've laid claim to all the goods that weren't 
shipped as duty for breech of agreement. The local solicitor informed him that it went outside 
of Kingdom custom, but the Riverpullers asserted it was also part of their royal charter. We 
still don't even know if such a document exists...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Is there any other way into Romney?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
There was a time when you could have hired someone to boat you in, but there's not a soul on 
the river who'd be fool enough to try to run the river blockade. River's nearly deserted because
of it. Only people who are still around are the one's who can talk a blue streak.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Really? And why is that?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
Unless you can haggle with the best of them, you'll not get even a fair price on any of the 
goods here on the river. Might as well try to buy King Lyam's crown as a packet of rations 
around here.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Perhaps you could give us a few of the finer points of haggling since you're in the trade...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
Perhaps I could, but...I really have to get to some of my associates in Sloop. I stand to lose 
quite a bit of money the longer I wait.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
We might be prepared to renumerate you for lost time if you could help.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
Really? Well, I suppose I might be persuaded to give you a hand for oh, fifty sovereigns. That's
my proposal. What do you say?<p>

You'll pardon me if I seem a little startled, but I half expected you to be dead men. I'm glad

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
We held our own. Did you attend to your affairs in Sloop?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
The Glazers there said they would send in a few men for support but they weren't sure how many 
or how soon. I'll have to take their word for it and hope their help doesn't become necessary. 
Now, how about that lesson on haggling? I could still use the funding. Interested?<p>

I say you're mad as old King Rodric, but I can't blame you for wanting to make an honest
sovereign. You have your deal.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
First thing, don't cross your arms when you talk. I know as a noble you have been taught to 
look as imposing as possible, but that won't wash when you're trying to buy a bolt of cloth. 
Look vulnerable or at the very least unimposing. Once you're human, it's a lot easier to believe
that you're in need of a break.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Sounds reasonable. What else?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
Look a man in the eye when he's talking to you. It makes him believe that you share interests 
with him and will usually lull him into a charitable mood. He's much more malleable when he 
believes he's the authority on the matter.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
But what if he isn't?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
Lesson three, never interrupt the man whom you're trying to buy from. Lesson four, right and 
wrong lose their meaning in a bargaining atmosphere. It doesn't really matter if the sword that 
the shopkeeper presents to you isn't the finest blade in the land. You are either interested in 
the blade at the price he quotes or you aren't. Insulting the integrity of his good will only 
earn you his scorn. Disinterest will more often lead you to better bargains...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Hmmm. A few things to think about and I daresay we may find uses for your wisdom elsewhere...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
My pleasure. I'd love to stay and chat some more, but I have finances to attend to. Farewell.<p>

<font color=#cc0000>FIRST TIME:</font><p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
I think we'll pass for the moment. I'm always interested in a bargain, but not at the cost
you're asking.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
Suit yourself, but beware. Most of the guilds in this region take this no less lightly than if 
the dog soldiers of Greater Kesh were poling up the Romney. This is war to most of us.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
They aren't far from wrong. Romney is a Kingdom village and as such, it is a free town. Any 
faction that has determined the city is to be closed against it's will deserves to be warred 
with, Kingdom writ or no. I am sure your Duke has something to say about it.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
He's none too pleased, that's for certain, but there's not much he can do about the matter until
he can get the head of the Ironmonger's Guild to come to negotiations. That's neither here nor 
there. I've got a bridge to watch and later, business to attend to in Sloop. I bid you gentlemen
farewell.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Good day to you. We shall speak again.<p>

<font color=#cc0000>SECOND TIME:</font><p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Sorry, but as we told you before, the price is too high for us.<p>

In the end, you'll end up paying the more for it, but that is your choice. Good day to you.<p>

The way ahead was blocked.<p>

From among the men who were guarding the bridge, a man stepped forward to confront them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
Do you have a Glazer's Guild Seal? I'll have to see one before I can let you across the bridge.<p>
We're trying to prevent a full scale guild war here and we have to make sure that no unfavorables 
show up. It's just a formality until we can get things settled down here again.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Guild war? What do you mean?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
There was an uprising here. Lasted for several months. The Riverpuller's Guild took charge of 
the other labor guilds and surrounded Romney. The crafts guilds tried to fight their way out 
and it seemed a losing battle until the King's men came up from Bas-Tyra. They managed to pacify
the Riverpullers' leader. The Duke of Romney's kept it from getting worse, but I can't guarantee
how much longer he'll be able. It will probably be a while though before we open up the roads to
the general populace.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Can the townspeople come and go at will?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
We've restricted visitors from the outside, not imprisoned the citizens. Any townsperson can come
and go at their leisure.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I assume the same may be said of your guests? May the men of the King's company come out and 
play? We have business with them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
I would be happy to help you but I'm not entirely certain I would know how to contact them. They
are hard to get into one place and I'm not sure that I've met their leader. They are a rather 
untrusting pack of men.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
They would have to be. When you're tracking assassins, you have to be craftier and a little less
moral than your prey... So, where would I go to get one of these seals?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
It's not that easy. There's a group near Silden that have been petitioning for membership for 
some time now. But they're an unruly bunch and can't find anyone to sponsor them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
But if I present a seal you will step aside with no questions asked?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
Well, not with no questions asked, but it would show that someone from the guild was vouching 
for you.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Enough, reeve. We will come back. In the interim, please deliver a message to the King's men 
from Bas-Tyra that three men will be here soon to visit with them concerning a nocturnal bird 
that kills at night. They will understand what the message means.<p>

From among the men who were guarding the bridge, a man stepped forward to confront them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
The city of Romney is sealed at the moment to all but the citizens and those who are members of 
the Glazer's Guild. Do you have one of our seals?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Yes. Why is a guild in charge of the city?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
The constabulary were all killed in the uprising by the Riverpullers Guild and no one else in 
any authority was left alive to administrate. When I was approached to take command, I decided 
that I would use my men in the Guild to help maintain order until such a time the Duke was able 
to arrive from his estates.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Makes some sort of sense. Where can we find the King's men from Bas-Tyra?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
They'll be holding up in the Black Sheep Tavern for a celebration of some kind. I believe I 
heard one of them say they've found something they were looking for. I'm not sure what it's all 
about.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I think that may mean good news for us as well. Good night, reeve. We're on into Romney...<p>

James knocked cautiously on the door.<p>

A few tense moments later the wood began to creak and the door swung open. From the darkened 
room a figure emerged and James gripped his sword tighter, prepared for any eventuality. Though 
Mitchel Waylander wasn't one of his favorite people, he was a bit relieved to see his familiar 
face...and Mitchel seemed a bit relieved to see <i>them</i>.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
I don't know who sent you, but I'm very thankful for your help.<p> 

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Let's just say that anyone on the business end of a Nighthawk sword is of interest to me these 
days. It's not like them to send multiple assassins unless the target is considered a danger to 
the guild.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
But I'm a merchant! I don't know anything about the Guild of Assassins!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
You wouldn't necessarily have to know anything about them. You might have witnessed something 
they preferred unseen, perhaps they think you've wronged them in some way. Where were you the 
night the King's men from Bas-Tyra regiment were assassinated?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
What?! I hadn't heard... Gods, they were good men! If it hadn't been for them, we never would 
have broken the Riverpullers' siege at Romney. How did they die?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Nighthawks set up on them in the Black Sheep Tavern. Killed every last man. The only thing I 
found strange was the fact there were few signs of resistance. I was told by the boy who tends 
the bar a few casks of Keshian Ale were delivered the night before, but the Bas-Tyra men are 
very disciplined men. Does it seem reasonable to you a detachment of men trailing the Nighthawks
would get drunk in the town where they suspect the Guild of Assassins have their headquarters?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
It does sound a bit odd.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
It sounded odd to me as well, so I decided the ale had been tainted in some way. I thought if I 
found the man who sent the ale, I might be on the trail of the Nighthawks. Then I visited the 
tavern here in town and I discovered something very disturbing. The arrangements for the ale 
delivery were made here and the keeper was instructed to add a significant amount of tarweed to 
the mixture, a mixture that while not poisonous, induces the drinker to become excessively 
thirsty, ensuring that he will continue to drink until quite drunk. But that was not the 
shocking information. You see, it seems the local chief reeve of a prestigious guild arranged 
for the delivery of the Ale...Mitchel Waylander!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
I never made that order! I would have been in Romney when the arrangement was made. I couldn't 
have made that order!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I realize that as well. The Nighthawks have gone to extreme trouble to implicate you and that 
tells me they want revenge for something. The men that were sent here to kill you would 
undoubtedly have planted the final evidence on your corpse. So, what could you have done to
them?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
Truly, I don't know...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Do you know anything about a silver spider or a brass spyglass?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
A brass spyglass? Oh dear gods! But that man couldn't have been a Nighthawk... He was so, so 
regal looking...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
What did you do to this man? Is the spyglass involved?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
There is a place north of Romney known as Prank's Stone. When people approach it, they often 
discover that items on their person disappear. A business partner and I discovered where the 
disappeared items go to and we sell the items we find. Any way, one night I was drinking in the 
town of the same name and I saw this man who had a very marvelous brass spyglass. My guild was 
having difficulties at the time and I was low on cash so I conspired to achieve the spyglass for
my own. I had noticed the attention he was paying to a rather fetching barmaid and I arranged 
that a note was sent to his table telling him to meet her near the Prank's Stone. The spyglass 
became ours...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
If the man you snatched the spyglass from learned what happened, I could see how he would want 
revenge. Where did you sell it?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
I don't sell the items. My partner does and we split the profits. I don't know anything about 
him other than the fact that he is a native of Silden. We decided early on that we would share 
only our booty so that if one of us was caught, the other would be safe.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Then it seems we have business in Silden. Lay low. It may be the only thing that keeps you
alive, Mitchel. The Nighthawks are not men that should be angered.<p>

We also found a silver spider and a brass spyglass on the bodies.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
A brass spyglass? I agree, that's very strange, very strange indeed. I wonder what they were 
doing with it? The silver spider though, that's definitely a sign. That's an assassin's tool.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Really? How is it used?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
I'm clueless. I've just heard that Nighthawks carry them sometimes. Maybe they dropped it on the
bodies when they were fighting...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
It's a lead at the least. Thank you, Mitchel. Where will you be if we need you again?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
I have a few debts to pay off for the Glazer's Guild in Sloop, so if you should need me I will 
be here. Goodbye.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
Have you found out who killed the King's men yet?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
We're on their trail and getting closer. I wanted to come and see you again because I visited 
the tavern here in town and I discovered something very disturbing. The arrangements for the 
ale delivery were made here and the keeper was instructed to add a significant amount of tarweed
to the mixture, a mixture that while not poisonous, induces the drinker to become excessively 
thirsty, ensuring that he will continue to drink until quite drunk. But that was not the shocking
information. You see, it seems the local chief reeve of a prestigious guild arranged for the 
delivery of the Ale...Mitchel Waylander!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
I never made that order! I would have been in Romney when the arrangement was made. I couldn't 
have made that order!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I realize that as well. The Nighthawks have gone to extreme trouble to implicate you and that 
tells me they want revenge for something. The men that were sent here to kill you would 
undoubtedly have planted the final evidence on your corpse. So, what could you have done to
them?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
Truly, I don't know...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Do you know anything about a silver spider or a brass spyglass?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
A brass spyglass? Oh dear gods! But that man couldn't have been a Nighthawk... He was so, so 
regal looking...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
What did you do to this man? Is the spyglass involved?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
There is a place north of Romney known as Prank's Stone. When people approach it, they often 
discover that items on their person disappear. A business partner and I discovered where the 
disappeared items go to and we sell the items we find. Anyway, one night I was drinking in the 
town of the same name and I saw this man who had a very marvelous brass spyglass. My guild was 
having difficulties at the time and I was low on cash so I conspired to achieve the spyglass for
my own. I had noticed the attention he was paying to a rather fetching barmaid and I arranged 
that a note was sent to his table telling him to meet her near the Prank's Stone. The spyglass 
became ours.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
If the man you snatched the spyglass from learned what happened, I could see how he would want 
revenge. Where did you sell it?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
I don't sell the items. My partner does and we split the profits. I don't know anything about 
him other than the fact that he is a native of Silden. We decided early on that we would share 
only our booty so that if one of us was caught, the other would be safe.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Then it seems we have business in Silden. Lay low. It may be the only thing that keeps you alive, 
Mitchel. The Nighthawks are not men that should be angered.<p>

The man walked over to join them. He stood before them, eyebrows arched inquisitively.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
I don't have time to chat right now. I've got Glazer's Guild business I need to attend to and 
far too many pots to glaze before the sun goes down this evening.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
We've come from Malac's Cross. Abbot Graves sent us.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
What about?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
The townspeople in Malac's Cross are calling for his head. He said that we should come and ask 
you for help.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
He's gambling quite a bit that I would help him, of all people. If I hadn't accepted his 
connections to the Crawler and the Guild of the Romney, the guild war might never have
started...blast him. Deep down I know he was trying to help us, but the trouble he caused...<p>
Do you think they will truly attempt to kill him?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
I can't be convinced, but the Abbot seemed convinced.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MITCHEL:</font>
He's wise enough to know... All right, then. I will give you a note to give to the Abbot. There 
is a Glazer's Guild office in Malac's Cross and they should be able to help him out, but I'm 
calling in the last of my favors. I'll probably lose the guild, but this is for a friend...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
I'm sure he will appreciate it. Thank you, Mitchel.<p>

I really don't have time to talk right now. I've got Glazer's Guild business that I need to

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Good day to you then.<p>
