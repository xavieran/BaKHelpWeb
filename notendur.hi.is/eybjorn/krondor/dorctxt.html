<h2>DORCAS' TREATISE ON THE ANIMATION OF OBJECTS</h2></center><hr>
<blockquote><blockquote><font size=+1>
Though it seemed clear to Owyn that Dorcas knew intimately the material about which
he was writing, he unfortunately assumed that his readers also understood many
principles which were obscure and unheard of by most magicians. In the
author's favor, he did make many useful points on the subject of <i><b>interrelation</b></i>,
the principle which allowed a magician to strike a target object with a spell,
and suggested that people first practicing the craft use a concoction called
Lewton's Concentrate to improve the accuracy with which they directed their spells.
