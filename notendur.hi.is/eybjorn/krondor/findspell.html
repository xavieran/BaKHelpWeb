There are 38 Spells in the Game, divided into 6 Categories. At the Start Owyn only has 5 Spells.
At the end of Chapter 3 he can easily hold at least 25 Spells. At the end of the Game, he can
hold all Spells, except Union, which he will never need. In version 1.02 he can only get Mind Melt 
by using the Cup of Rlnn Skrr in Chapter 9.<p>

<font color=#999900>
The below is not a complete listing of all locations where Owyn can get Spells, but rather
a guide to where he can get them as soon as possible, and as cheaply as possible. Full information
on all Caches will be found in the individual Spell Pages. The two numbers in <font color=#666666>[square brackets]</font> following
any mention of a Trapped Chest indicate the Minimum Lockpicking Skill required to deactivate the trap,
and the Damage resulting from a failure to do so. In the case of Locked Chests, one number refers
to the Minimum Skill needed - if two are shown, they refer to versions 1.01 and 1.02, respectively.</font><p>

<img src="transp.gif" width=10 height=1>Originally Owyn has none of these, but by the end of<br>
<img src="transp.gif" width=10 height=1>Chapter 3 he should have all but one or two.<br clear=all><p>

<a href="bane.html"><font size=+1 color=#cc0000>BANE OF THE BLACK SLAYERS</font></a><br>
Buy the Scroll for 300 Gold Sovereigns from either Dabeh's Fanciful Trinkets,
or The Grumbling Magician in Dencamp. In Chapter 4, Owyn can also get it from a Trapped Chest
<font color=#666666>[78-180]</font> North of Armengar.<p>

<a href="evilseek.html"><font size=+1 color=#cc0000>EVIL SEEK</font></a><br>
Can only be obtained from a Trapped Chest <font color=#666666>[83-25]</font> in the Sar-Sargoth 
Dungeon in Chapter 4.<p>

<a href="fetters.html"><font size=+1 color=#cc0000>FETTERS OF RIME</font></a><br>
Get it from the EGGS Chest behind the illusory house near Romney, rather than buy
it for 375 Gold Sovereigns from Daheh's Fanciful Trinkets. It can also be had from
an empty House in Wyke in Chapter 4.<p>

<a href="flamcast.html"><font size=+1 color=#cc0000>FLAMECAST</font></a><br>
Easily obtained early in the game from the CANDLE Chest off the Yabon/Tyr-Sog
Road, an ordinary Chest in a small valley East of Zun, or the DAY NIGHT Chest
off the Zun/Questor's View Road. Can also be bought from Brother Marc at Sarth
for 30 Gold Sovereigns, which is cheap, considering that the Shop price is 400
Gold Sovereigns.<p> 

<a href="skyfire.html"><font size=+1 color=#cc0000>SKYFIRE</font></a><br>
The only place Owyn can find this Scroll is a Locked Chest <font color=#666666>[77]</font> in the Upper Level
of the Krondor Sewers. Alternatively he can buy it for 350 Gold Sovereigns from the Stardock Annex in Sarth,
Hakha´s Cajunlo in Silden, or Dabeh's Fanciful Trinkets. He can also buy it from
Brother Marc for 100 Gold Sovereigns, but not until Chapter 2.<p>

<a href="strdrain.html"><font size=+1 color=#cc0000>STRENGTH DRAIN</font></a> <font size=+1 color=#666666>[version-dependent]</font><br>
In version 1.01 Owyn can get this Scroll from a Mound of Dirt in Dimwood (North Sector, near
Western Waterfall). [If he does, Patrus won't!] In version 1.02 he will have to wait until Chapter 8, and find it in a Mound
of Dirt in South-West Timirianya (where it will also be found in version 1.01).<p>

<img src="transp.gif" width=10 height=1>Originally Owyn has only one of these, but by the end of<br>
<img src="transp.gif" width=10 height=1>Chapter 3 he can have at least three more.<br clear=all><p>

<a href="despeyes.html"><font size=+1 color=#cc0000>DESPAIR THY EYES</font></a><br>
Held by Owyn.<p>

<a href="grie1000.html"><font size=+1 color=#cc0000>GRIEF OF 1000 NIGHTS</font></a><br>
Owyn can get this Scroll from the FARRIER Chest in North-West Dimwood (and thus make
it unavailable to Patrus). It can also be
had from the Sethanon Cache, but until Chapter 6 the road to Sethanon is guarded by an
army of Shades, not easily dealt with.<p>

<a href="madgrage.html"><font size=+1 color=#cc0000>MAD GOD'S RAGE</font></a><br>
Owyn can't get this Scroll until Chapter 6, either from a Trapped Chest <font color=#666666>[1-95]</font> South-West
of the Elvandar West Bridge, or the LIFE Chest in the Ancient Valheru Ruins.<p>

<a href="mindmelt.html"><font size=+1 color=#cc0000>MIND MELT</font></a> <font size=+1 color=#666666>[version-dependent]</font><br>
In version 1.01 Owyn can get this Scroll from a password-protected house in Dencamp. (If he does,
Patrus won't be able to get it in Chapter 5.) In version 1.02 the Scroll is unavailable. Utterly so!<br>
<font color=green>
[If you're handy with a Hex Editor, save the game, and change HEX # 2754 (decimal) to 1C. This will allow
you to enter the House and get the Spell!]</font><p>

<a href="thouclou.html"><font size=+1 color=#cc0000>THOUGHTS LIKE CLOUDS</font></a><br>
Owyn can find this Scroll in the BLOOD Chest near Sethanon, or the TABLE Chest near Kenting
Rush. Alternatively he can can buy it for 350 Gold Sovereigns from the Stardock Annex in
Sarth, or Dabeh's Fanciful Trinkets.<p>

<a href="touclims.html"><font size=+1 color=#cc0000>TOUCH OF LIMS-KRAGMA</font></a><br>
Owyn can only find this Scroll in Chapter 6, in a Locked Chest <font color=#666666>[68/64]</font> in the Lower Level of the
Mac Mordain Cadal.<p>

<a href="unfoflux.html"><font size=+1 color=#cc0000>UNFORTUNATE FLUX</font></a><br>
Owyn has two ways of obtaining this Scroll in Chapters 1 - 3, either buying it from
Dabeh's Fanciful Trinkets for 800 Gold Sovereigns, or finding it in a Trapped Chest <font color=#666666>[63-200]</font>
in South-East Dimwood. (If Owyn succeeds, Patrus will be unable to get this Spell in Chapter 7.)
Owyn can more easily obtain it in Chapter 4. Cullich will teach it for a fee of 300 Gold Sovereigns,
and it can be found in a Tent North of Harlech (if you drink from the Magical Well first).<p>

<a href="wratkill.html"><font size=+1 color=#cc0000>WRATH OF KILLIAN</font></a><br>
Owyn can only find this Scroll in two places. In Chapter 4 he can get it from a Tent
South of Caern. In Chapter 6 he'll find it in a Trapped Chest <font color=#666666>[1-95]</font> South-West
of the Elvandar West Bridge.<p>

<a href="finarest.html"><font size=+1 color=#cc0000>FINAL REST</font></a><br>
Owyn can buy this from Brother Marc for 100 Gold Sovereigns, but not until
Chapter 2. It is also for sale at Dabeh's Fanciful Trinkets, for 150 Gold Sovereigns.<p>

<a href="firestrm.html"><font size=+1 color=#cc0000>FIRESTORM</font></a><br>
Owyn can't get this Scroll until Chapter 6, from a Witch Hag in North-East Elvandar. In version
1.02 he can also get in in Chapter 9, from a Trapped Chest  <font color=#666666>[92-200]</font>
in Sethanon (Lower).<p>

<a href="gambit8.html"><font size=+1 color=#cc0000>GAMBIT OF THE EIGHT</font></a><br>

North of Armengar.<p>

<a href="rivesong.html"><font size=+1 color=#cc0000>RIVERSONG</font></a><br>
Owyn can find this Scroll in a Mound of Dirt in North Dimwood, near the Western
waterfall (and thus rob Patrus of his only chance!). In Chapter 6 it can also be found in the STARS Chest in North-East

Owyn can get this from the Sethanon Cache, but the road to Sethanon is guarded by an
army of Shades until Chapter 6. The Scroll can also be bought from The Grumbling Magician

is also Patrus' only chance).
In version 1.02 two more copies of the Scroll have been added in Chapter 6. One is

South-West of Elvandar West Bridge. As a last resort he can pick it up from a Trapped Chest

Owyn can buy this Scroll for 150 Gold Sovereigns from the Stardock Annex in Sarth,
Hakha's Cajunlo in Silden, and Dabeh's Fanciful Trinkets. It is also contained in
the Sethanon Cache, but this is not easily approachable until Chapter 6, because
of the army of Shades guarding the road.<p>

Easily obtained near the start of the game from the CANDLE Chest off the
