<font color=#ffcc00>PETRUMH:</font>
By my soul our petitions are heard! Finally, one of the Prince's men has come! Have you come
about...aigh! You've an elf!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Though Thorgath looks frightful enough, I assure you that he is of no danger to you. What is 
this petition you speak of good woman?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PETRUMH:</font>
As I live and breathe, not one word more will pass my lips as long as he is here, and that's 
the truth of it. Not one word more!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
I will leave you to your duties, Locklear. Should you need me I will be close at hand.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Thank you. He has gone, now... What cause do you have to call on Prince Arutha's aid?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PETRUMH:</font>
I sent to the Prince, for something must be done in Sethanon! If he would bend his ear to us, 
he would hear the tales of what passes in the Dimwood. There are lights there, terrible, awful 
faerie lights that have been seen in the woods and always they prefigure some calamity...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Surely they are only tales.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PETRUMH:</font>
If they are tales, they are tales as sensible folk tell! I have seen these very lights with my 
own two eyes, watched their demon jig in the night even as my husband fell senseless and 
breathed his last. There is some terrible evil there.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
I shall make no promises, but we will do what we can...<p>

Goodbye, Seigneur.<p>

James motioned to the figure across the room.<p>

The woman nodded, then made her way across the wooden floor until she was standing before them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PETRUMH:</font>
Wherever did you get those clothes, Lysle? Must have snitched them off a marquis somewhere!
You're getting a mild bit bolder aren't you?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I am afraid you have me mistaken for someone else. My name is James.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PETRUMH:</font>
James is it? Ha-ho, of course it is! And I'm not your gran Petrumh either, I take it. You're 
masquerading again! This isn't like that time you ran about Malac's Cross for a month begging 
and chewed up soap is it? Oh, but you made some fine sovereigns with that act! With all that 
foam coming out of your mouth, a body would think you had the creeping mongus and they'd pay a 
pretty coin just to have you away from them! You've always been a wily one, Lysle. Did you pinch
any bread for me?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Why can't you buy your own bread?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PETRUMH:</font>
Who pissed in your pot, eh? You know perfectly well that I haven't had nothing since Jack
died...unless... What are you doing with an elf, boy! Don't you know they bring bad luck?! 
They're the ones what killed Jack and are stirring up all that trouble in Sethanon! What's got 
into your head? Have you run mad?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
What trouble in Sethanon are you referring to, madam?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PETRUMH:</font>
You're...you really aren't Lysle, are you then? But you're his mirror image, you are. How could 
this be unless...some kind of faerie evil isn't it? That's what it is! Some kind of faerie magic
and you finally come for me! Took Lysle's form!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
We aren't brothers of the dark path, miss. Please, trust us. Perhaps I may bear some resemblance
to this Lysle character you're talking about, but we're just ordinary folk. I would like to talk
to Lysle, however. He sounds like...like he might be a relative...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PETRUMH:</font>
Hmm. I guess you don't look like evil faeries... Leastways, none I've ever heard of. So, Lysle 
might be your brother?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I don't know. I never knew my father and my mother never mentioned a twin, but when I was taken 
captive in Krondor a few of the men who were guarding me kept asking about places I'd never been
to and about people I'd never met. At first I wanted to dismiss what they were saying, but then 
I got to thinking about some of the events that happened before the battle of Sethanon. Someone 
tried to slip in a double for Prince Arutha. Maybe the moredhel are repeating their old 
strategies...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PETRUMH:</font>
This is all very interesting, but I haven't had a bite to eat in days. Do you think you could 
spare something for me?<p>

Last I saw of him, he was heading towards Lyton. Said something about wanting to meet some

A woman was moving down the road.<p>

Judging by her pace and the way she was looking over her shoulder, she seemed to be concerned 
that someone might be pursuing her. Afraid that the woman might be in danger of some harm, Owyn
called out to her.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PETRUMH:</font>
What are you doing on this road! You're not thinking of going into Malac's Cross are you?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Actually...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PETRUMH:</font>
The Abbot of the Abbaye Ishap's betrayed his students and his town and it's besieged by some 
kind of monsters! I should have known that I couldn't escape the evil that brought down Sethanon!
And likely your elf friend here had something to do with it!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Gorath has nothing to do with it, I assure you. What are these monsters and why would they be 
attacking Malac's Cross of all places?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PETRUMH:</font>
If you value you your lives, you'll help the villagers find the Abbot and deliver his head on a 
stake to those...snakemen! They've promised to leave everyone else alive if the Abbot is turned 
over to them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
If these are indeed some kind of monsters, what makes you think that they'll be satisfied with 
killing an Abbot?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PETRUMH:</font>
Who's for knowing? As for my own self, I'll be in Darkmoor drinking up the... Oh my, I've left 
my ale in the Queen's Row in Malac's Cross! Now I'll have none of the brew for weeks,
unless...unless you brave, you courageous, boys can go an fetch it for me!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
We have quite a few other things to attend to.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PETRUMH:</font>
Oh, please. It'll brighten up an ole missus day, specially one what hasn't a good home anymore. 
If you get it, you can come and bring it to my friend Ulam's house in Darkmoor...that's where 
I'l l be staying for a bit.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
I will see what we can do, but I can't promise you anything.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PETRUMH:</font>
That's fine love, just fine. I'll see you then. And remembers that my friend's name is Ulam. 
Good travelling to yous.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
And to you as well. Be careful on the way to Darkmoor.<p>

Petrumh opened the door.<p>

Surprisingly alert for an elderly lady who had made a trek from Malac's Cross to Darkmoor 
unescorted, she greeted them with a broken toothed smile and motioned for them to come in.
Shaking his head, Owyn remained rooted in the doorway.<p>

"Sorry, we don't really have the time to come in," he apologized. "We just wanted to check in
and see that you made your trip safely."<p>

"Oh, aye," she replied in her thick burr. "That I did. And what of you fellows? Did you by

"That we did," Owyn said, giving Gorath a meaningful glance as he handed over the cask.<p>
"Just where you left it."<p>

"A better lad I couldn't hope for," she gushed, taking the cask. Once she had set it inside
next to the door, she put her fingers to her mouth and whistled. "Oy, Ulam, where did you put
those things I told you?"<p>

From the back of the house they could hear another woman's voice replying, though they couldn't 
exactly hear what was said. Nodding, Petrumh told them to wait a moment longer, disappearing 
inside the darkened interior.<p>

"Here they is," she said, reappearing after a few moments. With a quick motion she shoved a few
trinkets into Owyn's hand. "Nothing all that special really, but you keep 'em. All right?"<p>

Again, the voice from the back of the house rose, but this time the words were faintly
discernible. "...and don't you let 'em in the 'ouse, Pet! Strangers are nothing but trouble..."<p>

Rolling her eyes, Petrumh sighed apologetically. "Sorry, I've got to go, afore Ulam a'lays a 
cow. Thanks again, gents!"<p>

"I'm sorry, but we don't have a cask for you," Owyn quickly lied. "But if we get to Malac's
Cross, we'll be sure and get it for you."<p>

"Ooah," she squawked, disappointed. "Well, that's a bit of bad luck then." Wiping her hands on
the front of her dress, she looked back to the interior of the house. I was a'fixing something
for Ulam to eat, so I best get back to it. Good day to you then, gents."<p>
