<h2>PUG'S FIRST NOTE</h2></center><hr>
<blockquote><font size=+1><b>
Tomas:<p>
As Katala no doubt summoned you, I imagine you have heard 
most of the pertinent details leading up to the time of my
departure from Midkemia. I will give you the details of the
circumstances once we meet, but I think it is more pressing
you know certain facts:<p>
Do not depend on magic. It does not function here in any way
I comprehend and I have concluded something has become of the
manna. Its absence may, in some way, relate to a second factor
I have discovered about this planet. I don't know to what extent
your inherited senses have already told you this, but there appears
to be evidence this world was visited by your Valheru benefactors.
A violent race exists here greatly similar to the Pantathians,
similar enough I think they surely must have been stranded here by
Alma-Lodka during the time of the Valheru raids across the cosmos.
You surely could judge better than <b>I.</b><p>
Gamina is still missing as yet, and I have made a sweep of the entire
island. I am going to head to the northern tip of the island to a ruin
I spotted there earlier. Perhaps I will find answers there.<p>
Pug of Stardock
