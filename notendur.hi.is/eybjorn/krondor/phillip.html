Someone was calling.<p>

Recognizing the lilt of the young voice, Owyn turned and looked back down the road. A young
squire that he had met at a party in Yabon was trudging behind them, a pack full of scrolls
slung over his shoulder. The squire waved congenially and Owyn echoed the motion.<p>

"What do you think you're doing?! We are trying to remain unnoticed! Damn," Locklear muttered
under his breath. "Try to behave as normally as possible. Since you know him, you handle him,
Owyn. And remember Gorath's name is..."<p>

"Thorgath," Owyn finished, irritated. "I'm not a child you know."<p>

Locklear whispered. "That remains to be seen."<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
I didn't expect to see you again quite so soon. I would have thought you all the way to LaMut by 
now.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PHILLIP:</font>
Would have been if the Duchess hadn't insisted in introducing me to all of her daughters. Amelia 
was the prettiest I believe, though I think Katherine took quite a liking to you.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Katherine took a liking to everyone at the party. She's as fickle as her mother. She'll likely 
marry a conDoin if she can find one not tied in the marital knot.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PHILLIP:</font>
True enough. Say, I thought you said you were from Tiburn. Why are you taking this route home?
Kind of a long way around isn't it?<p> 

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Well yes, but I had to meet up with my...uncle Locklear here. And my other friend here is an elf,
Thorgath. They decided that it would be nice for me to take a tour with them down to Kro..."<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Hawk's Hollow.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
...down to Hawk's Hollow. I hear it's lovely at this time of year. What are you up to?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PHILLIP:</font>
I'm looking to cash in a reward actually. When I was on my way up to Yabon last month, I found a 
chest in this area but I couldn't pick the lock on the thing. I figured it wasn't meant to be and 
I left off. Thing is, all through the Duchess' party I couldn't help but think about it. I had 
chest on the brain. I don't really care what's in it, but I have to pick that lock.

The crevasse was occupied.<p>

Standing away from a clutch of bushes, Squire Phillip impaled them with an flush faced glare
while he refastened the cinches of his pants. Deciding that his dignity was not irretrievably
beyond repair, he politely tucked in the tail of his shirt while he addressed Owyn.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PHILLIP:</font>
Not that I'm displeased to see you, Owyn, but you picked an odd moment to show up.<p> 

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Sorry about that. I didn't recognize you from behind and when we saw you duck into this cubhole
here we became suspicious. We've had a few problems with bandits on the roads.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PHILLIP:</font>
I've narrowly avoided some myself. Fortunately they didn't pay much attention to me. I don't
think father would have been too pleased if I'd ended up ransomed.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Did you ever find that chest you were looking for? <p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PHILLIP:</font>
A bit of a disappointment. Soon as I had the lid up, I found it was empty. I should have
expected that someone else would get there before me. Likely our bandit friends plundered it.

Not much to look at. It's a typical border town and the only thing of interest there 
is the castle itself. I understand that Prince Arutha paid for some of the
newer fortifications there after the Riftwar, but all in all I wasn't much 
impressed with it. However, I have to admit they had a nice armory there.
They keep some of the prettiest swords I've ever seen in stock.<p>

If seeing each other more than once a year can be called frequently. I guess that wedding party

Why are you in the eastern part of the Kingdom? I thought you lived in LaMut.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PHILLIP:</font>
On occasion, when my father will allow it, I sleep in LaMut, but I seem to spend most of my time
running the Kingdom roads on family business. By my estimation, he must have his fingers in more
pies than there are bakers in all of Midkemia! A trader has many things to keep track of and
only so many sons to help him...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Why doesn't he just hire a runner to do it for him?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PHILLIP:</font>
It's been suggested, most emphatically by those of us unfortunate enough to have been born to
him, but he likes to quote a Quegian saying about marriage: Why pay for what you can get for
free? Not to paint a poor picture of him though - he's just very practical about his money.

SQUIRE PHILLIP:</font>
The Fife? I've made a point of visiting it, and on many occasions. If it hadn't of been for a
pint of old man Kelly's lager, I'm sure I would have died of thirst on several occasions. It's
too bad they had to close up when the old man passed away.<p>

Please, do not leave us yet. Seigneurs, in ordinary circumstances I wouldn't be empowered to ask 
for your aid, but our forces are spread rather thin at the moment. We need every body we can get
to aid in this effort, whether you've sworn an oath to the secret garrison at Sethanon or not.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Sethanon Garrison? I've never heard Arutha mention anything about troops being stationed near 
Sethanon and you're far too young for senior duty.<p>

How old do you think I am?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Eighteen, maybe nineteen summers. About the same age as a squire we know from Tiburn.<p> 

<font color=#ffcc00>PHILLIP:</font>
While Count Beleforte's son Owyn was taking his first baby steps, my wife and I had already had 
a son for three years. I'm thirty seven summers old and hold the rank of Captain in the Kingdom
Army. When my commander noticed how young I looked, even as a veteran officer, he struck on the 
idea that I would make an ideal courier for the secret garrison.<p>

Sink me! A spy for the Kingdom!<p>

Even if the things you say about yourself are true the rest of your story's impossible. Arutha 
would have told me about a secret garrison.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PHILLIP:</font>
Has he ever explained to you why there is an absolute ban on visitation to Sethanon? Can you
recall any other occasion in which Prince Arutha or King Lyam have forbidden people to visit
battle sites?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
No, but I always assumed he wished to keep it as a memorial to the battle there.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PHILLIP:</font>
A memorial that cannot be visited by its veterans? You're trying to rationalize, Seigneur. Not 
even the members of the garrison are allowed near Sethanon unless an armed force approaches. 
Their orders are to destroy any who come against it. And now I must find a way to get word to 
them that the moredhel are advancing. Do you have any ideas on the subject?

Not surprising. We've had evidence the moredhel were spying on Sethanon for several months now
and it's logical to assume they've been stripping the local resources to pave the way for this
attack. They pulled the same trick the last time they headed to Sethanon. We anticipated
something was up and took the liberty of making some of our own provisions. Wilindi has
graciously lent us the use of her house for a while to store goods. Take what you need, but
please no more. We are far short of necessities. If you keep an eye out for old tree trunks,
you'll find some of the rations we've stored against this possibility, though I would be careful
