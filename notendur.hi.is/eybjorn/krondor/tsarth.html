From a distance the Abbey of Ishap at Sarth had seemed a fortress, its sheer 
walled courtyard dominated by an ancient single story keep. But closer 
inspection revealed that a shop profited where once an iron monger had forged 
swords, delicate flowers bloomed where soldiers had once mustered.

Light blinded Owyn.<p>
Screaming, he arched back from the doorway he had been about to press open and 
covered his eyes, as if averting some great horror. Stumbling backward into Gorath, 
he trembled in the warriors grasp.<p>
"Magic," Owyn gasped as last. "Terrible, terrible magic. It was like...like 
looking in to a nightmare. Someone has warded the door."<p>
Releasing his hold on the boy, Gorath stared at the doorway doubtfully. "Is there 
anyway you can banish it?"<p>
Owyn shook his head. "No, no. It is far too powerful. We will have to find 
another way in if we are to enter this place."<p>

Trees whipped at their faces.<p>
Mumbling about the inconvenience of castle engineers, Gorath lead the way down the fir covered

Owyn disappeared up the stairs. He returned a minute later, a look of grim
determination evident on his face...<p>

"These stairs must lead to the Mac Bourgalan Dok emerald mine. The tunnels are
very complicated, but with the instructions we found in Stellan's house we
should be able to make it through. Shall we try to find the library vaults?"<p>

Gorath nodded.

Together, they climbed the moss covered stone stairway that lead to the mines.
Bits of rock and splintered wood covered the dirt floor, making it difficult
for them to walk. But they picked their way through the rubble and after
nearly an hour came to a wrought iron ladder, piercing a dark hole in the
ceiling.<p>

The rungs were rusty, and metal splinters ripped at their hands and snagged
their clothes as though trying to deny them egress from the mines as they
climbed upward. The ladder ended up in a small wooden hallway, thick with
dust and decorated with silky strands of spiderweb. A door at the end of the
hall opened, after some effort, into a huge room stuffed with books.<p>

They had been heard.<p>

Assembled in the book lined passage were six priests, all keenly interested in
the arrival of the two strangers. From amidst them, a broad shouldered priest
stepped forward.<p>

"Your presence may explain a great deal," the priest said, stabbing a finger
in their direction. "We have been unable to leave the vaults since this morning
and we found the door is bolted from the other side. And since I find it
unlikely that our brother priests of Ishap have chosen to starve us to death..."<p>

"It's not like that at all," Owyn replied, waving his hands. "We ran into
your Brother Marc when we were coming up the road. He said that one of your
brethren has fallen ill with the Quegian Fever and somehow his condition is
linked to the passages being blocked..."<p>

"The mystic defenses?" one of the other priests offered. "It is possible his
delusions may have triggered them."<p>

Quickly a debate ensued between the robed priests, finishing at last with
several brethren scurrying off to shelves assigned for their examination.
With a stern look, the angered priest also pointed to a shelf and directed
that Owyn and Gorath look for anything that mentioned the mystic defenses of
Sarth or outbreaks of Quegian Fever.<p>

Hours passed...<p>

His eyes aching from reading the nearly illegible hand writing of ancient
scribes, Owyn leaned his head back against the ancient shelving. "I have no
idea what we're looking for, Gorath. I've run across a half dozen references
to this Abbey, but then I discover it has something to do with experiments
with peas or an account of a new system of organizing these books..."<p>

A sound drew their attention. At the end of the book strewn passageway in
which they sat, a priest eyed the disorganization with distress. "Why are you
still down here?"<p>

"Still looking for the answer," Owyn said. Vaguely he gestured at the half
dozen opened books around him. "Haven't found it."<p>

"Oh." Biting his lip, the priest seemed pensive about continuing. "Well, I am
afraid we solved that problem about an hour ago. Brother Dominic is doing a 
bit better now. We were wondering where you two had gotten to."<p>

Angered, Owyn slammed shut the cover of the book which he held in his lap, a
translation of Dorcas' Treatise On The Animation of Objects. Likewise, next to
him, Gorath stuffed away a wormy looking book on history... <p>

"Keep it," the priest insisted before Owyn could put away the magical treatise.
Dorcas' is popular here. We have other copies cross indexed in the library. I
was also instructed that once I found you, I was to reward you with these..."<p>

Opening a pouch, the priest handed them three nearly perfect emeralds. "They
are yours, in appreciation for all you have done here. It is a small gesture,
but I hope a useful one. Please feel free to continue to scan our library if
it please you..."<p>

A supernatural silence reigned in the vaults under Sarth, a perfect stillness 
which was unbroken even when a priest would accidentally let fall a book while 
searching the shelves or when someone would sneeze while opening a dusty volume. 
It was as if time itself had been frozen here, trapped between the wooden cases 
like pages within a book.<p>

Owyn smiled.
Of all the mysteries of the universe that the Brothers of Ishap at Sarth had failed to discover,
it was amusing the secret passage had gone undetected for so many hundreds of years.<p>

Owyn pushed on the bookcase.
Swivelling on a special hinge, it moved to the side, revealing a long timbered passageway 
which slanted downward. "Here is the secret passage," Owyn said. "Do you think we should 
leave by this route?"<p>

The books concerned <i>magic</i>.<p>
Snatching the closest volume at hand, Owyn began scanning the pages, hoping to find a gramarye 
of spells from which he could learn. Flipping pages, he was nearly oblivious of the priest who 
marched down the aisle and snatched the volume from his hands, politely replacing it from where 
it had come.<p>
"These books are restricted," the priest said sternly. "Long ago, we learned the wisdom of 
making sure an initiate has some training before embarking on reading our magical themas."<p>
"I've had some training," Owyn began, but was silenced by a hard look from the priest.<p>
"You are more than welcome to visit our other collections, but <i>this</i> is restricted,"
the priest said, his tone indicative that he would tolerate no argument. "I am sorry."<p>

Owyn studied the shelf.
While many of the titles on the shelf were either too faded to be read or printed
in foreign tongues, most of the subject matter seemed to be related to <i>theology</i>.<p>

The shelves were overburdened.
Massive books which all appeared to be older than anything Owyn could imagine, most of the
works in the section appeared to be concerned with theology or philosophy. Not as well versed 
in the history of the gods as he would like, he reached for a less intimidating looking volume 
and began to read.<p>

<font color=#999900>
Having expected by the title to find a book about Dala, the Protector Goddess, he was 
surprised to find that within seemed to be a registry of the names of people who regularly 
attended services at the temple. Also included was a special page which seemed to be a 
proclamation made by the priests of the Temple of Dala.<p>
</font>

<font color=#00aacc>
Henceforth Let It Be Claimed.
Blessed of Dala be the daughters of Flendel Halfgate; so named Thea, Andrea, Gena, 
Sara, Kira, and Larissa; who in good mercy hath been rightworthy and true to the goddess,
having provided much needed leather goods, grain, and entertainment for the woefully 
poor in their hour of need. From this day in the second year of the reign of good king 
Lyam the first, forever shall your issue be watched over by the fortunes of the goddess.<p>
</font>

<font color=#999900>
A ponderously heavy volume that took a great deal of effort to support, the book was 
permeated with the darkness of mood which seemed to surround Lims-Kragma, the Goddess of 
Death. Surprisingly enough, the book suggested the bodies of the dead should be burned 
rather than buried as the body was no longer of any importance after death. Of primary 
interest was a short passage near the end of the book...<p>
</font>

<font color=#00aacc>
...Once wounded so that ye may nearly touch the face of the goddess of death, thou shalt be 
suspended in a deathless state until it is deemed either thou time hast come to enter the 
Halls of the Dead, or thou has yet more to do among the world of the living. In such a
condition, ye shall find great weakness and a slowness of healing which may only be healed 
of a priest or by rest most prolonged.<p>
</font>

<font color=#999900>
Thankfully the contents of the book on Sung, God of Purity and Healing, were relatively 
light and easy to read, though it told him little he didn't already know about the Temple of 
Sung and its tenants. Before closing it, he did take special heed of the fact it implied 
that the Temple of Sung offered more extensive healing powers than those offered by any other 
temple.<p>
</font>

One of literally hundreds of books on the subject of Ishap, the God Above All, the book 
was difficult to understand and written in a barely legible hand. Setting it aside, he looked 
back at the other books on the shelves.<p>

<font color=#999900>
After an expansive description of Kahooli, the God of Revenge, and how he was often 
misperceived by most of the common folk of the Kingdom, the book made brief mention of a 
series of penances required of the faithful including an odd practice known as mortification 
in which they starved themselves to make themselves worthy to the temple. It also listed the 
fact that the most frequent petitioners into the temple were assassins.<p>
</font>

Just a few pages into the text, Owyn realized it was yet another book of dogma, though its 
author put a few new spins on religious theory he had been unaware of. After flipping 
through a chapter, he replaced the tome where he had found it... "Perhaps there is a more 
informative book on this shelf," he thought.<p>

Owyn studied the shelf.
While many of the titles on the shelf were either too faded to be read or printed
in foreign tongues, most of the subject matter seemed to be related to <i>finance</i>.<p>

Owyn scowled.
The books arrayed before him all concerned theories of finance, a subject which 
his father had long ago exhaustively bored him with. While he thought he would never 
again be interested in the subject, he found himself reaching for one of the volumes.<p>

<font color=#999900>
A very new looking book, Owyn had selected something titled <i>Strategies of Trading, Vol. II</i>.
Just below the title, he noticed a special note which had been glued to the face of the 
tome: <i>RARE</i>.
Flipping through the pages, tables and charts of numbers confronted him, most 
of which he supposed would take him weeks to understand, time he didn't have to waste. In 
the center of the book, however, he did manage to find something of use...<p>
</font>

<font color=#00aacc>
...At the suggestion of a colleague, I have decided to include here examples of the finest 
shops in the Kingdom, examples which illustrate my point rather elegantly that good 
attention to finances will allow the shopkeeper to offer the lowest prices without 
sacrificing significant profit and ensuring a reliable returning clientele:<p>

Dabeh's Fanciful Trinkets near Cavall Keep<br>
Roots 'N Herbs in Prank's Stone<br>
Arms of Dala in Wolfram<br>
Kingdom Goods in Loriel<br>
The Mercantile in Darkmoor<p>
</font>

<font color=#999900>
A pitiful remnant of what once was a wonderfully scribed book, numerous pages appeared to 
have been ripped out whole, leaving only the ragged remains at the edges. Disheartened, Owyn
glanced quickly at what was now the top page before closing and returning it to the shelf.<p>
</font>

<font color=#00aacc>
......many make the mistake of believing that a general goods store will offer the 
best prices on jewels. In practice, it is by far better to sell to a store which has 
emeralds, diamonds, and rubies on display...<p>
</font>

Immediately upon opening it, he discovered it was a simple ledger, containing only row upon 
row of numbers which didn't seem to add up properly in his head when he ran his finger across 
the columns. Closing it with a snap of his wrist, he replaced in on the shelf.<p>

Owyn studied the shelf.
While many of the titles on the shelf were either too faded to be read or printed
in foreign tongues, most of the subject matter seemed to be related to <i>medicine</i>.<p>

Healer's journals littered the shelf.
By far the most extensive collection within Sarth's impressive stacks of books, Owyn felt a 
little intimidated. Unsure what titles or names would be of the most use to him, he picked a 
book at random and began to read.<p>

<font color=#999900>
After skipping a fairly lengthy discussion about the benefits of various herbs, he found 
a list of fairly obscure potions and their effects, most of which he had never even heard. 
One item listed, however, was a familiar potion which he had cause to use on many 
occasions in the past.<p>
</font>

<font color=#00aacc>
RESTORATIVES.<br>
Generally, the use of these potions are well known among the common folk of the Kingdom of the 
Isles, but it is not so commonly apprehended that these formulas may help speed the healing 
process for those who have suffered near fatal injuries.<p>
</font>

<font color=#999900>
Quickly, he felt himself drawn into the book, apparently a journal which was kept by a 
healer who had travelled with one of the larger military companies of Bordon. While it 
actually dealt very little with the actual practice of healing, it did have a few useful 
bits of information.<p>
</font>

<font color=#00aacc>
...in comparisons, it has seemed that herbal packs by far offer 
more beneficial effects, but only inasmuch that they will do more for the injured in 
question over an extended number of days. Usually, however, my patients have been near
death and in need of the more immediate healing effects of restoratives.<p>
</font>

<font color=#999900>
More a book of home remedies and folk cures than anything else, there was little in 
the book about which he had not heard. Practically speaking, the only advice it had given 
of a practical nature was that it was better to sleep indoors in an inn while sick, rather 
than toughing it out on the hard, cold ground.<p>
</font>

<font color=#999900>
Of particular interest because it had actually been written within the walls of Sarth, 
the book was designed as a quick manual to instruct the reader on how to deal with the 
critically injured.<p>
</font>

<font color=#00aacc>
Immediately as may be performed, the injured party should be 
conveyed to the locality of an inn or other place they may spend the night out of the 
night's humors. Once bedded, it is advised they be administered four dosages of 
restoratives and a herbal treatment. Providing they are left undisturbed for a period 
of three days, the chances are reasonable that they will recover from their "near-dead" 
condition.<p>
</font>

<font color=#999900>
The newest volume on the shelf on which it was located, the book concerned itself solely 
with the administration of a new anti-venom, created by a Father Nathan of Krondor.<p>
</font>

<font color=#00aacc>
...following the unfortunate events which transpired shortly following the ascension 
of Arutha conDoin to the Princedom of Krondor. Unfortunately, since that time, border 
barons have seen a proliferation of the use of this poison, now harvested in mass dosages 
on the shores of Moraelin and elsewhere within the Northlands. If there may be said 
there is any good in this, it is that the new strains of Silverthorn now used are 
significantly less harmful than those used to wound Princess Anita ten years ago. 
Although many scholars have been speculating that perhaps only the nutrients in the 
soil near the Black Lake give the plant its lethality, the true cause of this shift is
unknown.
Fortunately, in the case of the Princess, I was able to formulate a 
Silverthorn anti-venom which may be taken internally to neutralize the poison, and it 
may be that I can make it into a treatment that may be smeared on armor to neutralize 
the effects of any Silverthorn poisoned blade which comes in contact with it.<p>
</font>

Unfortunately, much of the book he had selected was confusing or contradictory, and 
after struggling with it for nearly half an hour he finally gave up, putting it back
on the shelf where he had found it. "Next book...," he thought.<p>

Gorath studied the shelf.
While many of the titles on the shelf were either too faded to be read or printed
in foreign tongues, most of the subject matter seemed to be related to <i>warfare</i>.<p>

Gorath smiled.
Pleased to find something in the Vaults which appealed to his interests, he 
thumbed through a book which apparently had something to do with combat techniques.<p>

<font color=#999900>
Beginning as a basic soldier's text, it seemed there would be little of value to be found in 
the book, but moments before he closed it, he stumbled across a treasurehouse of information
in the last chapter.<p>
</font>

<font color=#00aacc>
This last chapter is reserved for the most well prepared of soldiers
who are also familiar with the enemies they are to face on the battle field. With an 
adequate amount of information before a battle, it is entirely possible for an enemy 
to be defeated even when the enemy has the advantage of surprise, providing you learn 
what their natural weaknesses are. By exploiting this feature, it is possible to take down
enemies who might otherwise seem unkillable. Based on reports gathered from soldiers 
from different battle situations, it would seem that the following things tend to be 
true:
Trolls in general seem to take more harm when they are attacked with any form of 
magic, but they likewise are quite resistant to physical harm. When fighting magicians
of any stripe, it seems they generally are poor when it comes to hand to hand combat, 
though there are exceptions to this rule. Though wyverns have never to my knowledge  
been exploited for use in battle, farmers troubled by the red variety have spoken of 
good results when attacking with blades prepared with an Althafain 's Icer.
I highly suggest that in the future you attempt to take notice of similar weaknesses and 
resistances so you may use your resources to the fullest of advantage.<p>
</font>

<font color=#999900>
Written by a magician, the text was rather muddleheaded when it came to the idea of various 
tactics, depending far too much on information gathered by spies or certain formations which
rarely worked as well as they looked on paper. Mixed in between a rather prolonged 
discussion of magically enhanced siege engines and battlefield enhancements, he did manage to 
find a useful snippet of information which he could relate to Owyn.<p>
</font>

<font color=#00aacc>
A rather simple tactic first applied during the battle of Carse against the goblins was the use 
of the spell sometimes known as Invitation. Thought of as a mere prank by studying mag icians,
it became quite effective during the battle when Althafain used it to drag a band of the 
Dark Brothers into a trap which they had devised.<p>
</font>

<font color=#999900>
Highly specific in nature, it dealt with a variety of tactics for dealing with an enemy 
when they resorted to using various ballistic or magical tactics. While he could understand 
most of the ideas involved, he realized it would take several months of practice for him 
to master any of the more advanced techniques. In the end, the most practical information 
ended up being the first few lines of the book.<p>
</font>

<font color=#00aacc>
If it may at all be arranged, it is best to confront your enemy on a battleground of your 
choosing in such a way that you have the element of surprise and command any setpieces which 
might mean the turning of the battle. If, however, your opponent has command of magical or
ballistic means, it is always a better stratagem to close range so as to deny him the ability 
to load his weapons without obstruction.<p>
</font>

Gorath scoffed as he began to read, realizing the author had little or no idea about the 
actuality of fighting hand-to-hand. Disgusted with it, he shoved the work summarily back 
into the slot from which he had pulled it. Examining the shelf full of volumes, he 
muttered to himself, "There must be another book here more helpful than that one."<p>

While many of the titles on the shelf were either too faded to be read or printed

Owyn pulled down a book.<p>
"A text of interest?" Gorath asked, looking over his shoulder.<p>
Owyn tapped the words on the spine. "It's a journal written by Pug - titled 'Regarding Theories 
of Trans-Spatial Gateways Proposed by Macros'."<p>
"Do you believe this is the book which we seek?"<p>
Responding only with a shrug, Owyn began to leaf through its pages, discovering immediately the 
majority of it was a technical document, filled with diagrams and columns of numbers with 
notations off to the side in a curious shorthand. Whatever the book contained was far more 
advanced than any of the things he had read on magic thus far.<p>
"He might as well be writing in Keshian," Owyn said, shaking his head. While searching for an 
index, he discovered a small addendum which related a few of his conversations with Macros.<p>
"This is interesting."<p>
"Something to help us find Pug?" Gorath questioned.<p>
"No, but something that might lead us to someone who might know something about this Book of 
Macros," Owyn replied with excitement. "It says here that someone named Tomas Megarson of 
Elvandar once travelled with he and Macros. Perhaps this Tomas fellow would know something 
about Macros or his book!"<p>

Smiling grimly, Gorath's eyes held a dark humor. "You intend then we should enter Elvandar? 
They will not be well pleased to see the likes of me."<p>
"Why is that?" Owyn asked, putting the book back on the shelf.<p>
"The kin of Queen Aglaranna and those of my blood are enemies of old. None enter Elvandar
itself save those sworn to her or are considered the most intimate of friends," he said.
"It will not be an easy journey."<p>
Chuckling, Owyn patted Gorath on the back. "After the past few months, I can't imagine this 
trip being all that difficult. Besides, we'll be back close to where we met near LaMut. I 
believe there may be a way through to Elvandar near there."<p>

Gorath stayed Owyn's hand.
"Enough of reading," he said. "We have a trip to Elvandar to make now. Let's be about it."<p>
