You will need the system file vbrun300.dll in order to run BaK-Hacker.

It should be located in the Windows\System folder.

<TD>BaK-Hacker is an extremely versatile program, that will allow you to

edit BaK saves. You can change Characters' Skills and Statistics. You can

add, replace, or remove Items from the Characters' Inventories, and modify

these Items at will. You can cure afflicted Characters (and afflict them).

You can even teleport to any possible (or impossible) location!

</TD>

</TR>

<TR>

<TD ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="icon.gif" ALT="BH Icon" HEIGHT=48 WIDTH=48></TD>

<TD>Version 7.3+ even allows you to switch Characters within a Chapter! Would you like to

play Chapter One with THREE Owyns? THREE Goraths? Or, if you are really

dying for a challenge - how about Patrus - ALONE!

</TD>

</TR>

<TR>

<TD ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="icon.gif" ALT="BH Icon" HEIGHT=48 WIDTH=48></TD>

<TD>BaK-Hacker also has many features, specially included for Hackers and

Testers. Among these are: the ability to switch Chapters, fiddle with Coordinates,

and keep track of Experience Points. And lots more. There are hardly any

limits to what you can do here - it all depends on your deviousness in

manipulating BaK!

</NOSCRIPT>

<TR>

<TD ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="icon.gif" ALT="BH Icon" HEIGHT=48 WIDTH=48></TD>

<TD>BaK-Hacker is "safe". It only modifies saved-game files, and NEVER

touches the all-important krondor.exe and krondor.001 files. If you somehow

manage to irretrievably mess up a saved game, this is YOUR problem. It

goes without saying that you should never fiddle with an IMPORTANT save,

unless you have a copy of the original (which can easily be created within

BaK-hacker).

</TD>

<HR><CENTER><B>In case of problems, first check out the helpfile.<BR>

Press F1 in the program, or double-click it in the program folder.<BR>

Most aspects of BaK-hacker are explained there.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>FOOTNOTE:</FONT></CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+1>The Webmaster would like to use this opportunity

to express immeasurable gratitude to two persons - Jay Sevara, who started

all this, and Fredrik Eriksson, who finished it!</FONT>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Here's the story:

<P>A year ago I hardly knew that hex-editors existed, let alone how

to use them, and couldn't have cared less. Enter: Jay Sevara.



<P>Jay sent me my first hex-editor, and patiently taught me how to

use it in order to hack BaK (or, rather, in order to figure out HOW to

hack BaK). Most of my spare time since then has been spent on this, which

is actually the reason why the Web hasn't been updated a lot :-)



<P>During my explorations I managed to collect a huge amount of hacking

data. The big question was: How on earth was I ever going to find the time

to add this data to the BaK Help Web? Utter despair. Enter: Fredrik Eriksson.



<P>Soon after I started corresponding with Fredrik, it became obvious

that he, too, was interested in BaK-hacking. So, of course, I sent him

some data, and then some more. Before I knew what had happened, BaK-Hacker

(version 1.0) had been conceived!



<P>BaK-Hacker (version 8.2) is the final result. The program is,

by now, only partially based on my original data. Fredrik has expanded

it far beyond my wildest dreams, and patiently dealt with all my whims.



<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Jay!</FONT> Thanks to you, wherever you are! (Are

you still somewhere out there?)



<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Fredrik!</FONT> Limm will, after all, not allow

us access to Hacker's Rest, but BaK will never be the same! Tack s&aring;

mycket!
