It's an awful mess from 'ere on out. Wyverns have come in from over the mountains and have 
singed things up a bit. If we'd 'adn't been beating back flames this past few weeks, we'd been 
through a month sooner! I doon't know 'ow many roads are passable at this stage. What kin o' 
yourn that come and 'elped us clear out the mess in the mine left as soon as word reached us 
that fires were approaching Elvandar.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Where did the Wyverns come from?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MCCANNUR:</font>
Whar else, lad? The Northlands! Some new bastard moredhel leader I hear harassing your kinfolk. 
I 'ope you 'aven t any kits in 'arms way.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
No... What of the Moredhel?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MCCANNUR:</font>
A few as what 'ad the nerve to cross over from the Moraelin 'ave already got themselves skewered,
though I know that the Prince Calin has been on the frontier looking for others. The biggest 
concern as yet is to put out the flames and get 'elp to those as got trapped behind it all.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Prince Calin leads? What of Warleader Tomas?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MCCANNUR:</font>
Poor news indeed. Three days ago, Tomas led a band o' elves to stem raiders what 'ad come from 
over the river near Moraelin. They beat the raiders back arights, but in the melee the Warlord 
took a thrust to 'is side with a tainted blade. They 'ad to carry 'im back to Elvandar, though 
I understand it wasn't without a struggle. Tomas wanted to stay, but word was carried back to 
Aglaranna of his condition and that was then end of that. Prince Calin assumed control of the 
patrols at that point and I ken 'e's still up near the north eastern fringe of the forest 
carving up moredhel.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Does the Warleader yet live?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MCCANNUR:</font>
That lad 'as ever been a fighter, and tenacious one at that. Sooner 'e'll let them cut a leg 
off than succumb to this poison. I wouldna worry. I think it took your kin for a turn though, 
seeing Tomas fall. I've never eard of it 'appening in the fifteen years 'e's been with your
folk.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
We are required in Elvandar quickly. You mentioned fires?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MCCANNUR:</font>
Extinguished now, though not without a fair portion o' foot stomping and bucket carrying! I 
thought for a while the whole forest might become all one ferocious blaze, but Tathar and the 
rest of Queen Aglarana's Spellweavers managed to put a 'alt to that business.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Then we should have no difficulty returning to Elvandar.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MCCANNUR:</font>
I don't know I would exactly say that. There's still a fair number of those Wyverns flappin' 
about the forest, though Tathar's been working night and day to bring the blighters down. Even 
taught Prince Calin a little bit of spellcraft what can bend the will of those cantankerous 
lizards, but I understand it still 'asn't put an 'alt to the raids.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
What of the dwarves?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MCCANNUR:</font>
Oh we've volunteered a few men, but as you elves don't much like outsiders in your realm, we've 
respected your borders. King Dolgan did send a few volunteers to 'elp out the Elf Queen, but the
lot o' them took a terrible weariness once they entered the forest and could go na further. They
musta fell afoul of one o' your fabled sleeping glades.<p>

If we may face Wyverns, it might be wise if we had our armor repaired. Are there any

Are there any leaves in Elvandar? You've gone daft! A course there are armorcrafters in Caldara!
You don't 'ave to go all that way though. I can repair it for a few gold, and if ya watch cloose, 
you might even learn a bit about the craft of repairing armor. Does a hundred sovereigns suit 
you?<p>

Suits me just fine. What do we need to do?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MCCANNUR:</font>
Well, lad, I'd be much obliged if you'd remove any armor you might have on under that tunic of 
yours and if your elf friend will do the same, we will get to work. Now just watch what I do...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Someone told me once a few dents in the armor can actually be beneficial. Something about them 
catching blows that would ordinary scrape along the surface and into the chinks? Makes some sort
of sense when you think about it, I suppose... Maybe it would be a good idea to make armor so 
that it already has bumps, facets! If it already had them built in, then the armor... You're 
already finished?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MCCANNUR:</font>
Aye, finished. You'll find your armor is in as good a condition as it can be lad, though I 
daresay you'd 'ave learned a great deal moore if you spent moore time listening and less time 
talking.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Sorry, but we don't have enough with us to cover the cost.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MCCANNUR:</font>
Well you'll not find another armorsmith as 'andy as I am with a 'ammer. When you 'ave time and 
the mooney, I'll be out and about in the area. I've got quite a few errands to run now the 
Cadal's been reopened.<p>

Don't mind if we check everyone else's prices first, do you?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MCCANNUR:</font>
That's your right I suppose, but I'm the best there is this side o' the Grey Towers. Be it on 
your own 'ead if a moredhel sinks his sword up to the haft through your innards.<p>

Another pair of eyes and arms and 'ope fully a brain betwixt! I'm glad to see the fires haven't 
burnt the two of ya to a crisp! We may need some 'elp with the folks up North. An elf printer 
came by ere not more than an few eyeblinks ago and said that Prince Calin and his escorts were 
set upon by Wyverns. As yet the young Prince may have survived, but three of the Warleader's men
are struck dead and the Warleader Tomas 'as been poisoned by moredhel arrow!<p>
