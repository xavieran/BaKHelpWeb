<blockquote><font size=+1><b>
No matter how many times he tried to make some sense out
of the markings on the scroll, Owyn was unable to to read
what was written on the scrap of parchment. "Looks like
it's written in some kind of guild code," Owyn said. " I hope
Abbot Graves will know better what to make of it."
