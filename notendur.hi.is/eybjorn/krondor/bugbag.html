<h2>THE GERMAN BUG BAG PAGE, PART 1</h2><p>

Note the innocent looking <font color="red"><b>BAG</b></font> above!<br>
This is what it holds:<p>
<center><img src="bugbag.gif" width=314 height=139><p>
There are definitely two items here that call for closer inspection! What's
that? A 165% Medium Crossbow, Poisoned and Flamed?! Can this be true?<p>
<img src="bugbow.gif" width=178 height=202><p>
Well, that's what it says ... But ....!<p>
Let's give it to Gorath, anyway.<br>
It's probably better than that fragile looking Elven Crossbow.<br>
I wonder what will happen, if he needs to use it, though ...<p>
And how about that yellow thingy? Is it some kind of Armor? Let's see:<p>
<img src="thingy.gif" width=314 height=139><p>
Hmmm .... it's even got a name, although it's slightly difficult to pronounce!<br>
Let's look at it through a magnifying glass ... <p>
<a name="back">
<img src="thingy2.gif" width=182 height=216><p>
But what is it? Well, since it is repairable I guess it must be some kind
of Armor I've never seen before. It's definitely neither a Sword nor a
Crossbow. Poisoned, Flamed and 107% ... they didn't say anything about this
in the BAK Help Web.<br>
Well, let's try to give it to Gorath ....<br>
He says there's no room for it! But there's plenty of room ...!?<br>
Does Owyn want it?<br>
Well, I guess he doesn't either ....<p>
Have you guessed what it is?<br>
Or can't you stand the suspense?<p>
<a href="bugbag2.html">HERE'S THE ANSWER!</a><p>
The German Bug Bag is a favorite of mine, and I'm most grateful
to my German E-pen pal for sharing it with me. It is actually good
for some more fun! I tried adding a pack of Owyn's Rations to it's
contents, and when I looked again, what did I see?<p>
<img src="roricbug.gif" width=88 height=60><p>
Yes, you're right!<br>
A Poisoned and Flamed Roric's Seal!!<br>
EXCELLENT!<p>
By adding another pack of Owyn's Rations I managed to call forth
another of these, but the third time around resulted in a very
interesting non-item, Poisoned and Flamed as usual. By non-item I
mean NOTHING, ZILCH, BLACK SPACE (invisible item?). When I tried
to drag the Poison Drop and Flame into Inventory, the game finally
froze ...<p>
<font color="red">
Well, I guess nothing's perfect!</font><p>
