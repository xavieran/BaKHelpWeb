Sumani clapped twice.<p>

Abruptly the festive mood of the room died, the clank of goblets and the scrape of plates
falling silent as the bartender shuffled between benches to bow at Locklear's feet. Touching a 
gnarled fist to his forehead then to his heart, he spoke somberly.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>SUMANI:</font>
Be welcome to the Blue Wheel Inn. May you find the drinks to your liking and the company of our 
patrons pleasurable. If there is anything our servants or I may do, you need only ask Sumani.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Ah...honors to your house as well...Sumani... Am I correct in believing this a drinking
establishment?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>SUMANI:</font>
So it is. We serve many of your Midkemian drinks as well as a few from the Tsuranuanni Empire 
as well. Perhaps I might interest you in a cup of chocha?

Why did you decide to come to Midkemia and open an inn, anyway? Surely you would get 
better business on Kelewan.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>SUMANI:</font>
I was not always a tavern keeper. As a soldier serving House Shinzawai under 
Earl Kasumi, I was trapped here when the rift gate was collapsed at the end of the Rift War.
It was our belief that we would never again see our families in Tsuranuanni or the green 
skies of Kelewan again.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
But Tsurani warriors traditionally kill themselves if they are in danger of 
falling captive to an enemy.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>SUMANI:</font>
This is true, lord, but the Earl informed us that we were forbidden to dispatch 
ourselves until given leave to do so by a Great One --- I believe in Midkemia you would call 
such a one a magician. Until such a time, I content myself with running the Blue Wheel Inn.<p>

There would be little to see at the moment. An internal conflict has arisen in the 
Empire between House Acoma and House Anasati. The Assembly of Magicians have ordered a 
temporary interruption of transport between the Empire and the Kingdom of the Isles until 
such time the conflict is resolved. I have been assured the measure is temporary.<p>

I shall meet you by the river in five minutes time. I should forewarn you, however, 
I sometimes seem quite different when I am armored for battle. I apologize in advance for

Locklear gaped.<p>

Striding down from the narrow doorway of the Blue Wheel Tavern was a figure that 
no longer bore any resemblance to a modest tavern keeper. Obviously having taken his time 
to refit himself, Sumani had donned a pitted suit of blue laminate armor, the greaves, 
breastplate and leggings all fashioned out of a light weight wood which creaked as he 
lumbered towards them.<p>

"Tsurani armor?" Locklear asked.<p>

Sumani adjusted his blue-plumed helm over his eyes. "I was a former Patrol Leader. The Earl
Kasumi insisted that I should keep the armor given to me by House Shinzawai. Although I no
longer serve in the garrison, my oath of loyalty is still to the Earl. Are you prepared for
your lessons?"<p>

"Yes, I think so."<p>

A mischievous glint reflected in the Tsurani's eyes. "Then defend yourselves."<p>

Locklear motioned for a halt to the lessons as he hauled himself for the third time out of 
the cold LaMutian river. "Okay, mercy, uncle, whatever it is you damnable Tsurani say when 
you want to surrender."<p>

"Your will, lord," Sumani chuckled, already beginning to resume 
his modest role as a tavern keeper. "I shall meet you inside the Blue Wheel once you have 
dried yourselves off."<p>

That is regrettable. If you were willing to speak to Earl Kasumi up at the

come back for my instruction. I think you would find it worth your while...<p>

You're asking a bit more than I had in mind. How much can it cost to repair armor?<p>

House Shinzawai to repair it. It is the way of my world.<p>

If your armor was the same as mine, I would suggest trying the garrison, but
Kingdom armor is made in a different way. I would think perhaps the dwarves in the Mac
Mordain Cadal would be of assistance. I understand from speaking to Dubal that the small
ones are gifted when it comes to the manufacture of weapons and armor.<p>

<blockquote>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
We were up at the Garrison earlier and they told us that a group of grey warriors 
stole a pair of rubies. Are the grey warriors some kind of special armed force on Kelewan?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>SUMANI:</font>
Special, yes, but not in the way you imagine. The grey warriors are men without 
honor, men whose houses have been destroyed by an opponent house. Such men must live off 
the land until they die, though I have heard that Mara of the Acoma has accepted many such 
men into her estate. Others have learned they may be granted freedom if they can reach the 
Kingdom. Many die trying...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Where would such men go once they got here?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>SUMANI:</font>
Away from La Mut, wherever they might go. Though the members of the Garrison here
are bound by Kingdom law, many of the soldiers still live by Tsurani custom, as I do.
It is not easy to fight our feelings about the grey ones.<p>

If indeed these grey warriors have stolen rubies, I suggest you seek out a man with a
tainted honor...Keifer Alescook in the town of Loriel. He is a gem merchant there, out
of his home.<p>

You listen between my words. This is the sixth such theft in the past year. Twice, 
gems have been stolen near the Assembly of Magicians from Great One Makala's entourage. 
That would be no simple feat to accomplish, even for a master thief. Whoever it is that is 
responsible, he must fear little if he doesn't fear the wrath of a Great One.<p>

I would take care following this thief, friend. I sense he is very dangerous.<p>

I had a very long conversation with him when he wished to buy a few of our Tsurani pots.

During the reign of forty four times Emperor Hidjucama, the lords of the minor
houses of the Omatu, the Xudumakal and the Hebatoki were summoned to the Holy City for an
audience with the Warlord. The Omatu, knowing the Warlord to be allied with the Ebon Fist
Party, decided they would present the Warlord with a woman of the Reed Life. The Xudumakal
were richer however and decided they would buy the Warlord a fine wooden sword from the 
Cho-ja hive on the estates of the Kenu. But the Hebatoki paid the greatest price of the day
and rode into the Warlord's estate astride a ferocious harulth. Immediately, the harulth
consumed the Reed Life prostitute and began destroying the Warlord's estate. Using the blade 
given by the Xudumakal, he beheaded the beast but broke his blade in the process. When he 
had seen what he had become of his fine gifts, he exclaimed, "Turakamu be praised! The 
Emperor shall love his new shoes!"<p>
