<blockquote><font size=+1><b>
Mates:<p>
It looks as if I may have opened my mouth a bit too wide. I think these funny talking
Elves what live in the Northlands may have caught on to the fact I've nicked some of their
booty. You best go and clear out our safe box near Hawk's Hollow, but remember I puts a lock
on it so none else could get in it.<p>
