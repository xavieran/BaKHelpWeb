THE CHAPTER BEGINS<br>
</font>

<blockquote>

Golden sweat traced his jawline.<p>

Discomforted in the unrelenting heat he stripped back his shirt sleeves 
and with passing humor noted the development of his sunburns. Within a 
month he doubted even his closest of kin would recognize him; his 
moonlight pale skin tinged a light almond color and his brownish hair 
streaked with golden highlights. All things considered, he felt very 
differently about himself now, felt more aware that there were bigger 
problems in the world than his own. Still, it was difficult not to 
dwell on his sudden... disability.<p>

Owyn contemplated resuming the meditations that had occupied him the 
length of the morning, but decided that in the space of four hours he 
had learned nothing he hadn't already deduced intuitively. For some 
reason, his magical abilities were useless in this alien environment 
and the prospect frightened him nearly beyond reason.<p>

"Another week beneath this strange sun and I shall seem pale next to 
you." Gorath shouted as he hiked back up the path, the dark strands of 
his hair dancing in a hot breeze. "This magician Pug must walk without 
leaving footprints! I can find no evidence of him. How progress your 
meditations?"<p>

Owyn shrugged. "No luck. I've tried everything from lesser path 
cantrips to greater path incantations. Nothing works. It's almost as 
if there were no manna here."<p>

Arching his brows inquisitively, Gorath motioned for the boy to 
continue.<p>

"Most people misunderstand the way that magic works," Owyn explained. 
"As a magician, I don't have power within me. All I know are a series 
of words and actions that help me gather the power, or manna, from the 
natural world. If, however, there is no manna for me to collect, then 
all of my magical training is futile. I'm powerless."<p>

"Would the same be true of Pug?"<p>

Owyn nodded. "He would be as helpless as I am, worse perhaps. If I were 
accustomed to having the kind of command that he has and suddenly lost 
it..."<p>

"He could be in very dire danger," Gorath said, finishing the thought. 
Leaning over, he fetched Owyn's staff from where it lay discarded in 
the sand. "I think that makes our journey all the more urgent."<p>

Gorath opened the door.<p>
Inside the alien structure they found a variety of odd shaped objects, some made of wood, others
fashioned from rock or crystal.<p>
"I feel strange vibrations in the air here," said Owyn. "This place is unlike the others we have 
seen, perhaps we should look around."

<blockquote>

Owyn nudged open the strange door.<p>
He gritted his teeth, waiting for a surprise attack. When none came he pushed the door open a 
little further and walked inside.<p>
He was stunned to find each wall completely covered with indecipherable symbols and markings. 
His attention was also drawn to a dark colored box in the far corner of the room. Moving closer 
to it he felt a strange tingling in his fingers, a sensation not unlike the one he felt 
immediately prior casting a particularly powerful spell. The feeling pulled him in, and without 
even being aware of the possible dangers involved he grabbed the box and threw open the lid. 
Inside he found a dark crystal staff!<p>
Holding the staff in his left hand he held up his right palm and whispered a simple incantation.
Flames leapt from his hand.<p>
"I can't explain it," Owyn said. "But this staff has rejuvenated my magic. It's as though the 
staff has been formed of -- I don't know -- <i>crystallized manna</i>."

Gorath approached the strange dwelling.
Head tilted slightly to one side he stared intently at the ground, listening, 
his eyes darting back and forth like fish in a bowl.<p>
At last he raised his head, "I cannot be certain, but I have a strong feeling we 
will be very unwelcome visitors here."

Owyn waited.<p>

When at last it became clear that the entity within was beyond reaching, he removed his hand
from the crystalline pillar. "Gone," Owyn said. "Either it's sleeping or it's died. I can't
tell which."

</td><td valign=top>

Owyn reached out to touch the column.<p>
Running his hand across the cool marble, he could feel a crackling energy nibbling at
his fingers like a thousand pinpricks. It was not a painful feeling, but it made him 
nervous and he quickly withdrew his hand.<p>
"This column seems to possess some sort of magical energy," he said. "But I cannot even
begin to tell you its nature. Perhaps we should take a look at the others as well."

<blockquote>

The pillar was smooth to his touch.<p>

Towering over Owyn, it seemed to be made of an exquisite crystal of some fashion, though it
was wholly unlike anything he had ever seen on Midkemia. Through it he could see refracted
images of the desert beyond, but when he varied the angle at which he held his head, it seemed
as though he could see other places which were not on the other side of the column. Instead, it
seemed that there were images of oceans and skies of other colors.<p>

<font color=#00aacc>
Your observations intrigue me. You are savani, are you not?</font><p>

Startled at the presence of the alien sentience in his mind, Owyn shook his head. Unsure whether
he should simply think his reply or speak it aloud, he decided that speaking it would be the
safest route. "I'm not familiar with the term savani so I don't know if I am one or not. Who am
I communicating with?". Nearby, Gorath threw Owyn a startled glance, apparently alarmed that his
friend was speaking to the air. Before Owyn could rattle off an explanation, the voice within 
his mind returned.<p>

<font color=#00aacc>
I am Sutakami, Mother of the Thousand Mysteries, once goddess of Timirianya.
You have summoned me. What do you desire to know?</font><p>

"I am not sure what you are asking," Owyn said. "Are you an oracle?"<p>

<font color=#00aacc>
No,</font> the voice replied. <font color=#00aacc>I may only tell you that which is already known, though I dimly perceive 
things that may come to be. I sense you are newly come to this world. Perhaps you would desire 
to see something of the creatures who inhabit the desolation of our world...</font><p>

Suddenly Owyn's mind reeled with visions of men with scales rather than skin and large hulking
creatures with shining carapaces which roamed the deserts. Grasping to retain what he learned
about the creatures as the information flooded through his mind like a tide, he at last seized
upon an image of a wispy figure.<p>

"What are these things I see?" Owyn asked. "They look as if they are made of smoke."<p>

<font color=#00aacc>
They are the ancient servants of Relynn Skarr, the last priest of Dhatsavan before The
Desolation. Creatures of magic, they can only be killed by special spells which drain directly
from their materiality, their strength. Now they still wander the ruins of Dhatsavan's ancient 
Temple.</font> For a moment the image wavered, then stabilized once more. <font color=#00aacc>I must rest... I am needed...
elsewhere.</font>

Energy blasted from the column.<p>

Dazed, Owyn picked himself up from where he had fallen in the sand, reaching for a hand up from 
Gorath. "There was this...presence...that was in the column. When I touched it I felt as if I 
would kill every single Panath Tiandn on the face of this world...as if I could have strangled
them all barehanded, and then the feeling was gone."<p>

"It is strange you should mention it, but I am feeling suddenly vigorous myself. But what are
these Panath Tiandn?" Gorath replied. "It is an unfamiliar term."<p>

"The snake men that we've run into. I'm not sure why I know that, but I know that is what they
are called on this world."

There was something odd about the column.<p>

Removing his hand, Owyn struggled to find words for what he was feeling. "You know how it is
when someone is standing behind you, and you know that they are standing there, even though you 
haven't heard them come up?"<p>

Smiling faintly, Gorath shrugged. "It is a sensation I have heard of, but I am afraid that is an
experience almost unknown with my kin." Reaching up, he tugged one of his ears. "There is little
that escapes our hearing."<p>

"Oh." Looking down at the ground, Owyn suddenly flushed, realizing how little he truly knew about
Gorath or his people. One day he would make a point of getting to know him better. "Well, I don't
know how to explain what I felt in the pillar except that it felt alive. Like there was a
presence within it, if only I knew how to reach it."

Warmth radiated from the column.<p>

At first Owyn assumed that the crystal was radiating heat reflected from the alien sun, but even
on the side away from the glare, the pillar seemed equally warm.<p>

<font color=#00aacc>
I may do little for you,</font> a feminine voice asked quietly in his mind. <font color=#00aacc>This much, and no more...</font><p>

Suddenly the sensation of heat grew, washed out from pillar like a warm breeze, shifting the
sand beneath their feet and pressing out in the deserts beyond. In a brief second the wind was
gone, leaving the pillar cold and quiet.

<blockquote>

The pillar was made of crystal.<p>

In better condition than the others in the circle, its reflective surface was not as pitted by
the blast of the sands as the others had been. Stroking its surface, Owyn marvelled at the
amount of work it must have taken the craftsmen to make.<p>

"I wonder what this place was originally," Owyn asked, not expecting the mental reply which
flooded his senses.<p>

<font color=#00aacc>
You stand in the ruins of Karzeen Mauk, once the high temple of the seven gods of Timirianya.
Once, these columns were only symbols of the gods, crafted by the savani artisans who were the
servants of Dhatsavan. Now they are the vessels within which we have taken refuge.</font><p>

"Refuge? What drives a god into refuge?" Owyn asked. "I wouldn't think it would be possible."<p>

<font color=#00aacc>
Valheru,</font> the voice said. Though without a true voice it was impossible for Owyn to tell, but
there were shadings within it that seemed a mixture of hate and sorrow. <font color=#00aacc>Those who were known as 
the Valheru extinguished all life as we knew it here, using this as a battleground where they
warred with all who dared challenge their universal supremacy. Only when Dhatsavan showed to us 
that our struggles would be futile did we create a plan by which we could drive out their hordes
of Pantathians and Kadaand Xekka'mati...</font><p>

"What did you do?" Owyn asked. A long silence greeted him before a distant reply came to him.<p>

<font color=#00aacc>
Of the Seven Who Ruled, there are only six of us who survived The Desolation. Two have faded so
far from the world they can no longer give voice to their thoughts, but instead are little more 
than sentient forces of nature. Only Dhatsavan will remain, waiting for the time of the Awakening.
He shall call us when the need has come... We shall not speak again, savani.</font>

Owyn hesitated.<p>

Shimmering in the hellish alien heat, it seemed probable the sun warmed crystal would blister
him if he touched it, but he was curious what material the glass-like pillar had been made of.
Privately he wondered if the serpent people they had encountered in the desert plains had been
responsible for the enigmatic monoliths, but somehow the idea seemed wrong to him.<p>

<font color=#00aacc>
No. The Pillars of Karzeen were not crafted by the Panath-Tiandn,</font>
a voice whispered in his mind. <font color=#00aacc>We made ourselves...</font><p>

Horrified by the sudden, uninvited intrusion of the alien presence within his mind, Owyn drew
back from the column, but the intruder remained.

<font color=#00aacc>
We seven were the gods of Timirianya, savani.
I myself was once Dhatsavan, Lord of Gates. But once the Valheru brought their wars of desolation,
we narrowly averted the great star death...</font><p>

"I don't know what any of the things you are saying mean," Owyn replied. "I have heard a very 
little bit about the elven old ones called the Valheru, but beyond that..."<p>

<font color=#00aacc>
It is unimportant, savani,</font> the voice said. <font color=#00aacc>What we were is lost beyond regaining, but there is
time yet to save your people from the same fate.</font><p>

"Our world?" Owyn asked. "The Valheru have been dead on my world for time beyond reckoning.
They can't pose any threat to us..."<p>

A feeling of disinterest washed through him as the god brushed aside the question.
<font color=#00aacc>
The one you know as Pug of Stardock will tell you more when the time comes for you and the Wanderer to make
your choices. For now, you must bring to this place the Cup of Rlnn Skrr. Do this and we will 
free Pug from his captivity...</font><p>

Suddenly suspicious about the nature of the entity which spoke to him, he worded his reply
carefully. "If you are a god, why do you need me to fetch a cup for you? And why should I trust
a bodiless someone who claims to have imprisoned the one we look for?"<p>

<font color=#00aacc>
You are wise to question,</font> the voice replied, <font color=#00aacc>but it is mine alone to know this truth. You may
do as I ask and bring to me the Cup of Rlnn Skrr or you may perish in the desolation of
Timirianya. The choice is yours. I warn you however it would be an unwise decision to utilize
its powers. Pug already has learned this lesson.</font>

</td><td valign=top>
<b>

Owyn tensed.<p>

For a moment he feared what the god's reaction would be once he learned that he had returned
without the Cup, but it seemed logical that he wouldn't be struck dead for it. On the balance
of things he felt rather skeptical about the true nature of the voices in the stones, but for 
now he would have to keep his suspicions to himself.<p>

<font color=#00aacc>
You still doubt,</font> Dhatsavan said, speaking within his mind. <font color=#00aacc>It is good you do, for it will be a 
quality which shall keep you alive in the future. Do as you will. We require the Cup of Rlnn
Skrr returned to us.</font><p>

"But where do we find this Cup?" Owyn asked. "We are strangers here..."<p>

<font color=#00aacc>
You will find that the Panath Tiandn hold it near the southeastern end of this isle. It is from 
them you must retrieve it.</font>

It is unimportant, savani,</font> the voice said. <font color=#00aacc>What we were is lost beyond regaining, but there is 
time yet to save your people from the same fate. You have brought the Cup of Rlnn Skrr to us and
that is of the utmost importance. The abandoned progeny of the Pantathians will now be denied
access to the Hall. We can be assured they will never again hear from their Midkemian mistress, 
though their reestablished contact with their brethren holds dire consequences for the future of
your world. But for now you have no need of concern. The cup's powers may now be subdued until 
the time it is needed again...</font><p>

"Since we appear to have done you a favor, may we ask one in return?" Owyn asked. "We are
looking for one named Pug."<p>

<font color=#00aacc>
He too has shared a destiny with the cup, but his was a crueler fate. He misapprehended the
scope of the cup's powers. When he wakened its powers to seek the mind of his lost daughter,
it overwhelmed him and reduced him to little more than a helpless child. We sent him to a
structure constructed by the Panath Tiandn. The protective barrier that has kept him within 
will be removed once you locate him.</font><p>

"You imprisoned him so you could protect him?" Owyn guessed. "To save his life?"<p>

An amused quality lent itself to the god's mental reply, though Owyn felt certain such feelings
were beyond a god.<p><font color=#00aacc>As an individual he is of little interest to us, but we saved his life in
honor of a kindness done for the last survivor of our world's holocaust by one known as Macros.
He knew of these events and asked that the one known as Pug be sheltered until you returned here
with the cup. Already he has regained most of his identity and memory, but his abilities will yet 
be impaired for some months. You will also find that the way is open to a place that would have
gained you your deaths if you had gone there, the ancient lands once occupied by the Valheru
during their wars here. There are artifacts there that may be of help to you in your quest. 
You may now leave, but take the cup with you. With it you may teach Pug the spells you know. It
may even be that it holds some greater destiny for you...</font>

</td><td valign=top>
<b>

Owyn touched Dhatsavan's column.<p>

Feeling the familiar presence stir within, he waited patiently for the entity to respond to his
mental call.<p>

<font color=#00aacc>
You have returned with the Cup,</font> the voice said calmly. <font color=#00aacc>That is well. The abandoned progeny of
the Pantathians will now be denied access to the Hall. We can be assured they will never again
hear from their Midkemian mistress, though their reestablished contact with their brethren holds
dire consequences for the future of your world. But, for now, you have no need of concern. The 
cup's powers may now be subdued until the time it is needed again.</font><p>

"Pug's welfare still remains," Owyn said firmly. "We have run to the limits of this island for
you, now we wish to know where you have kept him."<p>

He is safe within a structure constructed by the Panath Tiandn. The protective barrier that kept
him within the structure will be removed once you locate him. He misapprehended the scope of the
cup's powers. When he wakened its powers to seek the mind of his lost daughter, it overwhelmed 
him and reduced him to little more than a helpless child.</font><p>

"You imprisoned him so you could protect him?" Owyn guessed. "To save his life?"<p>

An amused quality lent itself to the god's mental reply, though Owyn felt certain such feelings
were beyond a god. <font color=#00aacc>As an individual he is of little interest to us, but we saved his life in 
honor of a kindness done for the last survivor of our world's holocaust by one known as Macros.
He knew of these events and asked that the one known as Pug be sheltered until you returned here
with the cup. Already he has regained most of his identity and memory, but his abilities will 
yet be impaired for some months. You will also find that the way is open to a place that would 
have gained you your deaths if you had gone there, the ancient lands once occupied by the 
Valheru during their wars here. There are artifacts there that may be of help to you in your 
battles. You may now leave, but take the cup with you. With it you may teach Pug any of the
spells you know.</font>

DHATSAVAN: PUG'S VISIT</b></font>

<blockquote>

Pug studied the column.<p>

When he had visited the site at Karzeen previously, he had sensed the sentience that radiated 
from them, but had been unaware of the true nature of the beings who inhabited them. Stepping 
forward, he made a slight bow.<p>

"Greetings, cousins of the Aal," he said. "I regret that I did not recognize you on my first
visit. My apologies. It was only during the time I was in the tent that something the Oracle
spoke of once occurred to me."<p>

<font color=#00aacc>
Apologies are unneeded for such as we, savani, but we accept your tribute. Your safety was 
greatly prized by Macros.</font><p>

Pug nodded. "He has been a true friend to me, only as one other has ever been. It is an honor
that he prized me so highly. I sometimes wonder that he will ever stop protecting me."<p>

<font color=#00aacc>
You have not come to us to waste thanks on us, one called Pug. What do you wish from the gods
of Timirianya?</font><p>

"I came here in search of my daughter, Gamina. A magician, a savani by your terms, brought her 
here against her will. It is important that I find her and return to my home to avert a
possible catastrophe. Forces are gathering to tamper with the Lifestone."<p>

For a moment there was silence, the only motion in the air made by the rasp of the sands moving
in the deserts. Then, quite abruptly, Dhatsavan's voice returned.<p>

<font color=#00aacc>
Your daughter is caged by Panath-Tiandn. They believe her an omen that Alma-Lodka has heard
their pleas and is preparing the way for her return.</font><p>

"Is she in any danger?" Pug asked. "Is there something you may do for her?"<p>

<font color=#00aacc>
No,</font> Dhatsavan replied. <font color=#00aacc>Such as my powers once were, they are limited, part of the price we paid 
for continued existence.</font><p>

"You exhausted your essence when you crystalized the manna to drive off the Valheru. When their 
magical abilities seemingly began to wane, they assumed they had tapped the manna of the planet 
dry and moved on."<p>

<font color=#00aacc>
Your speculations are deft, savani. But the gods of Timirianya are not yet dead. We will abide 
until the time comes when we either sleep or until we can be reborn through these children of 
the holocaust. Perhaps once they have forgotten Alma-Lodka and the rest of the Valheru, they can
mature in their own ways.</font><p>

Pug accepted the information calmly and began to turn to leave, then halted. "Has Makala placed
any special spells around her? I am very limited in my abilities at present..."<p>

<font color=#00aacc>
Seek the old hordes of the Valheru. There may be something there to assist you. Farewell, Pug.
Dhatsavan shall speak no more.</font><p>

Pug waited.<p>

When at last it became clear that Dhatsavan was beyond reaching, he removed his hand from the
crystalline pillar. "He is gone," Pug said. From now on, we must help ourselves."<p>

I gather you do understand how this place was not always as it is now. At some point, after
Gamina is safe, please inquire further... As for now, it is enough to know that when the Valheru
left this land they left behind something else as well. Whatever it is, it would be buried, like 
their ruins. For it to have remained intact for so many years, it must have been protected by
some sort of magical defense...perhaps one produced by the Pillars.

Rubbing his nose, he stared in confusion at the scene before them. Some invisible force was
preventing them from moving forward.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>
OWYN:</font>
That Pug is involved seems likely, but my instincts tell me he didn't construct this. Why put
up a force barrier around a tent? I would imagine his priority here is to find wherever it was
that his daughter Gamina disappeared to and get back home.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>
GORATH:</font>
Then you suspect that this tent is somehow a means of imprisonment?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>
OWYN:</font>
Something along those lines, yes. Either for Pug or Gamina or the both of them. We have to
find who has the manna and discover what it is that they want before they will set Pug free.

There was motion in the tent.<p>

Pushing back the strangely woven doorflap of the tent, a short man stepped forward and squinted
at them. Unassuming in most respects, he walked casually forward, as if it were not at all
unexpected that he would find humans in the strange desert world.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>
PUG:</font>
Where is Tomas? It is important I speak with him.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>
OWYN:</font>
He was unable to come and he sent us after you. He gave us the spell which you left
to him...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>
PUG:</font>
Unable to come? Why? What has happened to him?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>
OWYN:</font>
He was injured during an attack on Elvandar by the moredhel. Queen Aglaranna assures us that
he will be all right...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>
PUG:</font>
I can't believe that Makala's plans would be served by sending you here, so for the moment I
will have to trust your word... In looking at you, it occurs to me your face is familiar. Are
you the magician boy who came into Krondor with Seigneur Locklear a few months ago?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>
OWYN:</font>
Yes, and you remember Gorath?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>
PUG:</font>
His face has been hard for me to forget these last few nights. He was the first tool of
Makala's in this grand scheme...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>
GORATH:</font>
You accuse us of being liars and spies?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>
PUG:</font>
I'm not implicating you were a willing participant, Gorath. You were as unknowing in your part
as I must assume Delekhan is in his. When you said he had raised the war banners of Murmandamus
over Sar-Sargoth, I became somewhat alarmed.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>
PUG:</font>
Having seen Murmandamus' death with my own eyes, I had no reason to believe he still lived,
but forces acting in his name caused the calamity at Sethanon and I thought it possible the
Pantathians were once again responsible. After some investigation I found they were indeed 
interfering with affairs in the Kingdom, but were acting through a band of magical thieves
searching for various magical items - trinkets - in no way directly responsible for what was
happening in the Northlands or posing immediate threat to Midkemia... With the issue resolved, 
I believed then Delekhan was merely exploiting the reputation of his predecessor to
gain power...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>
OWYN:</font>
So then what did Gorath tell you that was so important?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>
PUG:</font>
It was only after Makala tricked me into coming here that Gorath's testimony to Prince Arutha
took on any significance. In passing, he had mentioned Delekhan wearing a helm of black, shaped 
like a dragon. Murmandamus wore such a helm and had it with him when Prince Arutha cut him down...
Whoever had given Delekhan Murmandamus' helm had to have had been inside the caverns beneath
Sethanon.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>
PUG:</font>
There are only four magicians I can think of who might have had the wiles to slip inside the 
first perimeter of defenses that have been placed there. One is Macros, but since he was
instrumental in averting catastrophe there, I cannot believe he would be responsible. Another 
is a magician whom Macros once told me of, named Nakor the Isalani; but again, I have reason to
believe the Northlands would hold little interest for him. The only others who would be capable 
are Elghar and Makala, but Elghar has been quite busy with his students at Stardock...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>
OWYN:</font>
Leaving your only suspect as Makala. But why is he doing all of this? Why would he be pushing
Delekhan into a war with the Kingdom?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>
PUG:</font>
If he was ingenious enough to get within the caverns, he would still need considerable help
achieving his final objective - a chamber containing an artifact of unbelievable destructive
power about which he has been indefatigably interested. I left behind a dragon to guard it,
and even my powers would be sorely taxed in a single battle against a dragon her age, let alone 
one with the special capabilities of the one who sleeps under Sethanon. Once she is alarmed,
she will no doubt summon help from a secret garrison of soldiers which King Lyam ordered to 
remain in the region of Sethanon, soldiers whom Makala surely would have detected on his first 
visit and intends to counter with Delekhan's moredhel troops...<p> 

<font color=#ffcc00>
OWYN:</font>
But that's why Prince Arutha sent us to find you! He's afraid that Delekhan is going to have 
magicians working at the siege at Northwarden! Maybe if we can stop them there...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>
PUG:</font>
Unfortunately, I'm of no use to anyone at the moment, let alone Prince Arutha. In my blind 
haste to find Gamina, I used a magical artifact that would have best been left alone...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>
OWYN:</font>
We already know something about it. You said before that you were going to have to trust us, 
so you'll have to trust me now when I tell you I think I can help. I hope for all our sakes 
that I'm not wrong about this...<p>

The door was unlocked.<p>
Cracking it open, Pug peered into the formless darkness of the shaft. When no one replied to his 
shouted greetings, he turned to Gorath.<p>"No one down there," Pug said. "Might be interesting to take 
a look around. Feel like blundering around in the dark for a few minutes?"<p>

<font color=#cc0000>
YES:</font><p>

An hour passed.<p>
After moving through a long stairwell that seemed to twist and wind in unexpected directions, 
they found themselves standing on an earthen floor...

Daylight filtered in from above.<p>
"This way leads out," Gorath said. "Are you sure you're ready to get moving again, Pug?"<p>

<font color=#cc0000>
YES:</font><p>

Light guided them.<p>
Following the ascending shaft into daylight, they emerged at last on a path leading to the
south.

STRANGE STONE SLAB</b></font>

<blockquote>

The slab was strange.<br>
Slightly larger than a fully grown dwarf, the stone seemed very old and Owyn wondered if it
might have been part of some ancient religious ritual.<p>

Gorath approached the slab.<br>
He studied it carefully for several minutes, tracing his finger over the twelve unintelligible 
symbols which were carved into the rock face. "It appears to be nothing more than a large stone 
slab," he said. "I was rather hoping there might be something else about it. As prominent as it 
is, I was thinking perhaps it might have a notch or a groove in it somewhere. Perhaps it's a 
marker of some kind..."

A foul smell filled the air.<p>

Somehow, the creature before them had sensed their presence, and now was turning to attack.<p>

Owyn gasped at the strangeness of it, and turning to Gorath, he shouted, "We may have made a
grave mistake..."

Their approach was undetected.<p>

For a moment Pug froze, whispering, "Gamina!" Though the confrontation would be difficult, this
was a moment he had long waited for.<p> 

"These bastard subservients of Makala must die," he thought as he advanced into battle.

THE CHAPTER ENDS<br>

<blockquote>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
She lives. Makala has many blessings to count.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
Gorath, see if you can do something about the cage...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Cover your head and stand back!<p>

Pug took Gamina into his arms.<p>

Eyes glistening with relieved tears, he hugged the girl tight to his 
chest and for a long moment he simply held her, his head resting in her 
silver-white mane of hair, while he mulled through recent events. At 
last he slipped a finger beneath her chin, gently lifted, and allowed 
his gaze to lock with hers as they initiated the special mind-speech 
that had been Gamina's gift since birth.<p>

<font color=#00aacc>He was lying father, all that time</font>, Gamina thought. <font color=#00aacc>Even when he 
brought me here. He was trying to get you away from Krondor!</font><p>

<font color=#00aacc>I know, I know</font>, Pug thought in return, pushing a stray wisp of her hair 
into place. <font color=#00aacc>I shall have to see you better guarded in the future. I had 
always supposed that your gifts would keep you safe from harm, but I 
see my pride in you sometimes borders on the dangerously arrogant. We 
must be more careful. Agreed?</font><p>

<font color=#00aacc>Agreed.</font><p>

Again she hugged herself to him. Feeling her faint nod, he released her 
and kissed her forehead, looked to where Owyn and Gorath stood at the 
cave mouth. Curiously, the squire was bent double, his face buried in 
his hands as he shook with violent coughs.<p> 

"I'm okay," Owyn wheezed, waving his hands, occasionally stealing 
glances at Gamina. "Really, I'll be fine."<p>

Pug smiled. The boy's theatrics were poor, but it was manifestly 
obvious he wished an introduction before his lungs collapsed. "Gamina, 
this hacking young ruffian is Squire Owyn Beleforte of Tiburn. Both he 
and Gorath have been instrumental in helping find you. Perhaps we 
should have them down to Stardock for dinner someday."<p>

"Stardock?" Owyn's performance faltered at the mention of Pug's Academy 
of Magic. Realizing his lapse, he coughed tentatively into his hand. 
"You mean, the Stardock?"<p>

"None other." Pug frowned as he drew out a small multi-faceted stone 
from the folds of his robe. "This special pattern stone should take us 
there, but we have to drop off Gamina before we attend to our 
business."<p>

"We will go to join Prince Arutha?" Gorath asked.<p>

"No," Pug replied, clapping his hands overhead. "We go to Sethanon!"<p>
