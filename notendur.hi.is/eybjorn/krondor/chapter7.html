THE CHAPTER BEGINS<br>
</font>
</center>

<blockquote>

Bells tolled in the towers of Northwarden.<p>

Jubilant guards shouted from the walls, slapped backs, exchanged war 
stories only days old. Already a bard was milling through the crowd, 
gathering names and places, scribbling them down as fast as he could. 
Tonight they would gather, and they would drink, and they would pay 
old Tamney the Minstrel each time he sang their names.<p>

Listening to the general hubbub drifting in through an opened shutter, 
Seigneur James allowed himself a grim smile as he dropped down to where 
Arutha and Locklear conferred over a battle map.<p>

"By day's end, I warrant that Delekhan will have died on the sword point 
of every man here," James said. "It's a shame he wasn't really leading 
that raid."<p>

"Indeed," Arutha agreed, his eyes shrouded as he brooded about 
something. "I would like to ask him a few questions."<p>

"I leave for Highcastle at noon. Even though the moredhel have turned 
from here, I am certain that the first of them will be upon our troops 
there by sunup tomorrow. Fortunately, my army will be there to greet 
them. Still, I wish I knew what they were up to."<p>

Arutha glanced up, startled, as a page boy skidded into the chamber.<p>

"Your p-p-ardon my lord!" the boy stuttered. "They have captured the 
moredhel raiding leader!"<p>

Without pause, Arutha's eyes hardened. "Prepare him for questioning."<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
Cooperate now moredhel and I promise you'll live to see your children 
become adults. Daunt me and I'll have your eyes for necklace beads and 
your manhood for an inkwell!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MOREDHEL:</font>
My death will be unimportant...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
If you think we shall torture you unto death, I would advise that you 
ponder my mood. Anxious though I am to have answer, I will keep you 
screaming this side of death a month or a year or until I feel well 
satisfied that we have heard all that you have to say!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MOREDHEL:</font>
A day, a month, you've already lost! Nail my entrails to your door 
post, feed...my brain to your dogs, it will not matter! Even if you 
act now, you will be too late!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
You will win only pain for your trouble! Instruct him, torturer!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MOREDHEL:</font>
You do...not...listen!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MOREDHEL:</font>
We know...the secret of Se-thanon! We shall free him!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
What secret? Why to Sethanon?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MOREDHEL:</font>
Ten years ago we attacked...with Murmandamus...you captured, imprisoned 
him...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
Deluded fool, we killed Murmandamus at Sethanon and burned his bones 
for potash! There is nothing there for Delekhan to find!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MOREDHEL:</font>
A lie...we have spied...What else could...you guard so closely?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
How does he think he will win past our garrison at Highcastle! He 
hasn't enough men!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
Answer me!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MOREDHEL:</font>
Riiift-machine!...The Six have a machine...It can take them place to 
place...like a door between great distances...Even while your troops 
die at Sethanon...we will walk through the machine!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MOREDHEL:</font>
We shall be through the Dimwood and inside Sethanon a week before you 
can reach us! Your troops will be exhausted! The day will be ours!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
A rift-machine inside the Dimwood! That bastard Tsurani magician has 
been consorting with Delekhan!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
Torturer, tell Seigneurs James and Locklear to ride to the Dimwood. 
They must find and destroy that rift-machine while I hie to Highcastle 
and divert our forces once more! Time is of the essence!<p>

James stopped.<p>

He looked at the band guarding the pass ahead and called out, "Will you allow us safe passage?"<p>

A self-important looking guard glanced up from what he was doing, and replied, looking them over
with a great measure of disdain. "We have orders that no one is to pass in or out of the Dimwood."<p>

"Whose orders?" James challenged.<p>

"From who originally, I'm certain I haven't a notion, but when my commanding officer gives an
order, I follow it," he replied. Reaching for his sword and placing it's point into the soil in
front of him, he stared menacingly at them. "Of course if you wish to make a point of challenging
the wisdom of it, you are more than welcome to try us on."<p>

Locklear stepped forward and stood next to James. "What's the point of fighting it out with our
own?" he said, seeing his friend's temper flaring. "It's runs counter to what we want to
accomplish. Once we charge, they may forget who they're fighting..."<p>

James shook his head.<p>

"It's this fellow's attitude that gets me. So, do we fight or leave?"

Locklear stepped up to the leader.<p>

"We'll kick your behind all the way to the Northlands," he boasted.<p>

Quickly, James stepped forward to confer with Locklear. "Have you finally lost what little wits
you have?  Are you trying to get us killed?", he asked. "Besides, this path is leading us AWAY
from the rift machine we came to destroy."<p>

"Trust me," assured Locklear. "I think we can take them."<p>

As they prepared for battle the Goblin guard called to others hidden in the pass. Locklear
shuddered as he saw warriors move from behind the trees, realizing the pass was indeed blocked.
"On second thought, perhaps you shouldn't trust me," he said to James as they faced the first
ranks of the advancing mob.

James scowled.<p>

"Let's head back," he said. "This way leads out of the Dimwood and away from the rift machine.
Arutha entrusted us to find and destroy it and I'll be damned first before I let him down on
this."

<blockquote>

Patrus was beginning to look pale.<p>

James felt a little guilty for having dragged the magical adviser along on such an extended
mission, but since he had no knowledge whatsoever of magic, Prince Arutha had thought it wise
to at least have him take a look at the alien rift machine. What none of them had counted on
was that they would have been making much of their journey on foot.<p>

For days they had ridden at a panicked pace, astride three of the finest chargers lent from the
stables at Northwarden. Driven too hard for too long, the horses had all died within hours of
one another, expiring long before they had reached the outer rim of the Dimwood forest. From
there, they had been forced to walk, sneaking past a patrol of goblins who were taking up a
defensive position on the road leading north out of the Dimwood.<p>

Now, far behind enemy positions and without quick transport, they had a very difficult task
ahead of them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
So...nothing much to accomplish. Find something the size of a man in the whole of the Dimwood.
Shouldn't be too difficult.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Not the most difficult thing Arutha ever had us do. Remember that berry hunt we went on after
the Riftwar? Very nearly wouldn't have found them if we hadn't realized the rain fall had been
heavier that year. I'm just sorry we had to drag poor old Patrus along on this one.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PATRUS:</font>
You worry 'bout your own skins, you whelps. I ken I can run with the best of 'em and you two
ain't no exception. Get runny nosed on me and I'll brain the both of you.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Better listen to him, Jimmy. He's a killer.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Umhum. I believe you're right. So, where do you think we should start looking for this rift
machine? Your guess would be a good as mine.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Since we just came from the north, I'd say it's a good bet it isn't up there anywhere. That
still leaves east, west, south and everything in between. Like spearing fish in a barrel.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
That being the case, I suppose we just try to be as systematic as possible. I say we make a
sweep east, then maybe move to the south or the west.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
East? Why? West seems as good a direction.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Not sure. But the instinct that's telling me east is the same one that's kept me alive this
long, and I've learned not to ignore it. If you've got a better idea, I'll follow your lead...

The rift machine hummed.<br>
Formed by a pair of staves driven into the ground, and topped by two metallic, 
mushroom shaped objects, it sometimes formed the shadows of the moredhel waiting 
at the other side of the gate...<p>

The air smelled of camphor.
James took a step forward, intent on examining the strange device before him.<p>

"No!" cried Patrus, grabbing his shoulder. "This is the rift machine we have been searching for.
It is very dangerous and I would not advise getting too close."<p>

Patrus was nearly frantic. "We must devise a way to destroy this machine before Delekhan
transports an entire army through here!"<p>

James held the Waani in his hand.<p>

"I pray to Ishap this wooden gem works," he said. "Though I hate to think about the fate of
the Kingdom resting on this little experiment, I fear that is the truth of it." He took a deep
breath, "Well...shall we give it a try?"<p>

</blockquote><center>
<img src="divsmall.gif" width=375 height=9>

The Waani arced gracefully through the air.<p>

James grunted loudly, nearly falling from the momentum of his throw. He glanced up just in time
to see the strange wooden object pass between the two crystal-topped posts.<p>

The Waani never made it to the ground. Powerful lightning-like blasts rocketed out from each
crystal, ripping it into thousands of tiny fireflies of light that floated gently downward to
a cold death on the dusty forest floor. The ground trembled, and before they could utter a sound,
an ominous humming buzz rolled towards them. Growing in intensity with each revolution it rose
before them striking like a hammer blow, knocking them from their feet in a roaring rush of
energy and sound.<p>

Still dazed, they watched in horror as the energy storm reversed direction. Suddenly it was
rushing back through the rift machine, sucking leaves and dirt and small stones with it!<p>

An angry scream of air raked at James and Locklear like the claw of an 
invisible beast, tugging at them as if to stuff them whole into the 
insatiable black maw of the collapsing rift machine. Desperately they 
called out to Patrus to grab on to something, but for him it was too 
late...<p>
