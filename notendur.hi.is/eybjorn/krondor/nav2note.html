<blockquote><font size=+1><b>

Navon,<p>
I'm concerned by Count Corvalis' increasing patrols in the area, and 
I think he will soon discover the entrance behind the waterfall. I know you 
don't credit him with much intelligence, but his patrol may accidentally 
follow one of Delekhan's envoys. Please return south of Cavall Keep as soon 
as possible.<p>
