Owyn halted.<p>
As if seeing the [Item] for the first time, he held it up for inspection and shook 
his head, "I've got to get my mind on the business at hand," he muttered with 
self-deprecating humor. "Next I'll try putting jam on my sword and eating toast 
laced with silverthorn."
</b></td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor=#002222><b>
Owyn changed his mind.<p>
As great as the temptation was to use it, he sensed it was neither the time nor 
the place to waste its potential by performing experiments. There was always the 
possibility it would fail him when he most needed it, but that was far more 
desirable than squandering what might be a valuable resource when it would gain 
him nothing.

<tr><td bgcolor=#002222><b>
The [Item] would be a problem.<p>
"What precisely am I to do with this?" Gorath asked, his lips twisting into a scowl. 
"I suppose it's useful in the right hands but I don't know the first thing about 
how to use them."
</b></td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor=#002222><b>
Owyn put the object away.<p>
Though he was fascinated by the [Item], he realized that this was neither the time 
nor the place for him to be toying with it, especially when spying eyes might be 
watching him.
</b></td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor=#002222><b>
He cursed himself.<p>
With he and his companions at death's door, all he'd managed to pull out of his 
satchel was of utterly no use under the present circumstances.
</b></td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor=#002222><b>
Locklear had no idea what to do with the [Magical Item].<p>
"I could be wrong, but it looks like a magician's handiwork," Owyn said. "I'm not 
sure if I have room in my rucksack right now, but I'll take it off your hands if 
you like." 
</b></td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor=#002222><b>
The [Fighter Item] would be a problem.<p>
"I have no use for this," Owyn thought, his lips twisting into a scowl. "It might 
do Gorath some good, though..."

Owyn sighed.<p>
Although he was fairly certain when he read the first few lines that he knew the 
spell, he read it to the end to see if there were any critical variations which 
might be helpful to him. Finding that it was exactly identical to the spell he 
already knew, he put the scroll aside.<p>
"Oh well," he sighed. "Perhaps I can find a generous shopkeeper with more use 
for it than I."
</b></td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor=#002222><b>
Owyn drunkenly demanded more liquor.<p>
"You've had quite enough," Gorath said, calming his companion. "Time to call it 
quits."
</b></td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor=#002222><b>
James studied the vial.<p>
He had thought to drink more of the liquid, but his head was still swimming with 
the effects of the previous dose and it occurred to him that a second drink 
might do more harm than good.
</b></td></tr>

"This map would come in handy," Owyn mused, "if only we were in a place we could 
use it."

ITEM IS USELESS (No Charges left)</b></font>

<tr><td bgcolor=#002222><b>
Owyn cursed.<p>
"Dead weight," he said, evaluating the [Item]. "We've expended all its charges. It 
might be a good idea to get rid of it." 
</b></td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor=#002222><b>
Locklear frowned.<p>
"This [Item] doesn't work as it once did," he said with an angry scowl. "It might 
still be worth keeping, however. At the very least, there might be someone who 
would want to buy it."
</b></td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor=#002222><b>
Patrus cursed.<p>
"Useless," he said, staring at the [Item]. "Must have depleted all its charges. 
Maybe I'll be able to revitalize it later..."

TRANSFERRING ITEM TO BAG (Discarding Item)</b></font>
</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor=#002222><b>
Locklear shoved the [Item] into a spare bag.<p>
"Someone will probably find this, but I'm tired of carrying it," he said. "The 
bag will at least keep it protected from the elements."
</b></td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor=#002222><b>
Gorath sighed.<p>
For a moment he'd thought to discard his [Weapon], its bulk wearisome for him to bear 
and its value seemingly more dubious than when he'd acquired it. On the balance, 
however, he realized it would be utter madness to strip himself of his defenses 
at a time when he most needed them.
</b></td></tr>

Owyn averted disaster.<p>
Shaking his head, he was thankful he'd had presence enough of mind to catch 
himself before dropping a flaming torch to the ground.

It was a wasted effort.<p>
No matter how Owyn rearranged the items that had been stuffed into the canvas sack, 
it seemed he would be unable to add the [Item] to the bundle without removing 
something else. "Looks like the bag is full up."

Gorath pawed the dead body.<p>
"I don't think we dare put anything more on this body," he said, checking a 
rucksack which dangled from the corpse's shoulder. "Anything more and there's a 
good chance our tampering will be detected."

Locklear scowled.<p>
"As much as I'd like to keep what we've found, we can barely manage with what we 
already have," he said. "Check your rucksacks. See if you can't make enough room 
so we can keep our new acquisitions with us."

Gorath waved off the [Item].<p>

his shoulders. "I've got enough to tote around as it is with out taking on your 
baggage."

Gorath didn't look up.<p>
Either too dazed by the clamor of battle to respond or too focused to take his 
attention away from it, Gorath seemed oblivious to Owyn's repeated attempts to relay 
the [Item]. If Owyn had any hope at all of transferring the object, it lay in getting 
closer to his ally.

Gorath jerked the [Item] back.<p>
"I'm using that at the moment, thank you," Gorath snapped, startled by Owyn's rude 
behavior. "If you need something from my pack, you're welcome to what ever I 
have there, but I would appreciate it if you asked first."
