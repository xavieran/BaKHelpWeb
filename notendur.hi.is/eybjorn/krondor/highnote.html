<h2>SPY NOTE CONCERNING HIGHCASTLE</h2></center><hr>
<blockquote><font size=+1><b>
Delekhan:<p>
We have studied the defenses of Highcastle in anticipation of your
planned assault and have discovered three weaknesses which may be
exploited before the attack: The trolls that live nearby may be used
to disrupt the flow of supplies to the castle without raising significant
suspicions about our interference, many of the guards within the castle
appear to be suffering from the wounds we have inflicted on them during
our continual raids of the <b>last</b> few <b>months,</b> and it appears
there has been some problem in the delivery of the pay from Rillanon and
many within the castle are beginning to grumble about their situation. We
shall report again when we know more.
