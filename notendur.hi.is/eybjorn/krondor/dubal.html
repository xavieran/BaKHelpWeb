The dwarf drew on his pipe.<p>

Languid smoke plumed from the old codger's mouth as he studied Locklear, Owyn and Gorath each in
turn. Although he had long ago lost the use of his left eye to a moredhel swordstroke, his right
eye still burned brightly beneath his bushy eyebrows.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DUBAL:</font>
Being as a dwarf ne'er forgets as much as his own name, I ken I recognize a strapping young man 
before me who last I saw was a boy.<p> 

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
No slight intended, but I fear I don't recall the occasion...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DUBAL:</font>
As like the rest of your human kin...none among you can remember much past a week. If not for 
we canny dwarves you would have forgotten that you have a Kingdom at all! I fetched you out of 
a cellar along with a score o' womenfolk at the Battle of Sethanon! Doncha remember me,
Locky?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Dubal, of course! Glad to see you! I hadn't recognized you without the eye patch.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DUBAL:</font>
What's a dwarf to do? I won this scratch fair an' square and I'll be a dragon's mother before
I'll cover it up again. Shouldn't have done so in the first place. Now I just sit here to 
jabber with that loon of a Tsurani bartender and 'ave me a few beers. Not much to do with the 
Mac Mordain Cadal all collapsed... A Brak Nurr has been seen down there. They'll be offering a 
hefty reward for its slaying I'll mite you if tradition holds, too. Something of a challenge as 
they are fierce beasties even by dwarven standards.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
I've heard tales of these creatures of stone. Thank you, Dubal.<p>

James motioned to the figure across the room.<p>

The dwarf walked over to join them. He stood before them, eyebrows arched inquisitively.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DUBAL:</font>
You think quite a bit o' yourself, doncha lad?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Perhaps. What makes you think so?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DUBAL:</font>
Most folk enter a room, they looks to the left, to the right, check out the lay of a place then 
they choose where to go. When you come aprancin' in, you walk straight in as an arrow as if 
nothing could stand in your way. No one does that that's not stupid or very good with a knife...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I'm not stupid.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DUBAL:</font>
Didna think ya were, but I'd wager a month's salary that you've done some time as a thief.<p> 

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I suggest you lay a hefty amount on the wager. You'd win. But all that was a long time ago.
I'm in the service of the Prince now.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DUBAL:</font>
Are ya now? It's a shame almost. There's a new section of the Mac Mordain Cadal that's just been
reopened by the workers - there was a terrible collapse there not too long ago ya know - and they
say that there's a chamber there just heaped up with treasure.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Why tell me? Why not get the treasure yourself?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DUBAL:</font>
That would be stealin' from meself - it's dwarven treasure after all - Besides I wouldna 'ave
the desire to try. If you're no thief, I've nothing to worry in telling you, and if you
are - again, I've nothing to worry about. We don' exactly leave treasure just laying about
unless its for good reason.<p> 

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
And what reason would that be?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DUBAL:</font>
Let's just say that there are certain things in this world that ya either are or are not
supposed to 'ave. If ya were meant to tooch somethin', you will. If not, well then...fate
sorts that sort of thing out.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I believe you're right about that, Dubal. A lesson I've learned the hard way.<p>

Dubal scowled.<p>

Bent over his pipe, he prodded a thumb into the meerschaum bowl until a weak blue plume issued 
forth to fill the room. With a frustrated growl he jammed the smoking thing into his mouth, 
muttered aloud in his thick dwarven burr.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DUBAL:</font>
Set flame to a Midkemian tobacco and you'll 'ave an hour's respite from the world. Set flame to 
a Tsurani weed though an' you'll be lucky to get so much as gnat's spit of smoke from it. For 
all I know, they probably cut it 'alf an' 'alf with gwali dung.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Mind if I sit with you a while?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DUBAL:</font>
Sit where ya like, lad. I don' own the stools, but if it's a ramble you're after then Dubal An 
Loch is the right gaffer. Have a good story to tell, laddie?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Dangerous question, but I would be willing to bet yours date back rather longer than mine.
Right now I'm a bit preoccupied. We're on the trail of a murderer.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DUBAL:</font>
Ach, you'll pollute tha Blue Wheel with talk like that. We're happy folk 'ere and I'm not in a 
mood ta have it put to ruin. Ya need to be a little more cheery, like Sumani.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
The barkeep? He's a nice fellow for a Tsurani I suppose, but he seems sort of stoic... Not
exactly a bundle of laughs...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DUBAL:</font>
'ees a bloddy riot, that one. Got a joke what'll split your sides and 'ave you peeing your skins
in an 'eartbeat. Course, being Tsurani, 'is jokes do take a bit of getting used to. They 'ave a 
funny wise way o' lookin' at a thing.<p> 

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I'll agree they are a strange bunch. I think the only one that I've ever met is a man they call
Charles - never could pronounce his given Tsurani name. He works for Duke Martin in Crydee.<p> 

<font color=#ffcc00>DUBAL:</font>
Weel go on an' ask Sumani 'bout his joke what he told me earlier. In the meanswhile, I think I'm
going to 'ave me a quick smoke in quiet for a bit.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Fair enough. Thanks for chatting with us.<p>

Owyn motioned to the figure across the room.<p>

The dwarf walked over to join them. He stood before them, eyebrows arched inquisitively.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DUBAL:</font>
Oh, ya've doone it now, lad. I'd be surprised if that ole Tsurani even ever spoke to ya again.<p> 

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Why? What did I say?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DUBAL:</font>
I... Nothing wrong, not leastways by the standards of the Kingdom. But Sumani, now he's not of 
the Kingdom, is he? Least not so he 'as the Kingdom way of thinkin'. These folks from Kelewan 
have queer ways of looking at a thing and by me reckoning you've just insulted his honor by 
bringing up his getting the boot from the Garrison.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
I... I didn't mean to offend him. I was just curious.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DUBAL:</font>
As any would be, as any would be. But these Tsurani now, they 'old honor aways and aboove all 
else and if they be lacking in honor, then they feel they 'aven't the right to live. If not for 
a wee lie I told him a year or more ago, I suspected he would 'ave ended 'is life by now.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
But what did he do to warrant a dismissal?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DUBAL:</font>
I can't say as he's been exactly talkative about it, but as I'm a dwarf, I've poked around a bit
and I think I've pieced the truth of the tale together. It seems aboout three years ago Sumani 
was mistakenly assigned the duty of standing watch over the LaMutian graveyard. Now he 'ad
already stood a double watch that day so that a friend of 'is could tie the marital knot and 
he 'ad been up late the night before attending to a laboring calf. Unfortunately, some clod
working for the Earl forgot to take note of the fact and arranged that Sumani stood watch for 
twenty six hours! Try as he might, he eventually fell victim to exhaustion and nodded off at
'is poost.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
But it wasn't his fault.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DUBAL:</font>
True, but 'tis not the end of the tale. When 'is relief came, it was a certain arrogant bastard 
captain whose family 'ad some feud with Sumani's family. As punishment, he forced Sumani to 
sleep the next night in a freshly dug grave along with a corpse recently dead of the consumption.
The idiot clerk's mistake was eventually found out by Earl Kasumi, but Sumani felt as if he 
brought the dishonor upon 'imself and 'is former house by falling asleep.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
That's terrible! And he is still living with this on his conscience?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DUBAL:</font>
That's the prooblem. The Tsurani would ordinarily poison themselves or run themselves through
with a thing like that on their minds. They simply 'aven't 'ad the experience of knowing 'ow to 
let go of a mistake and go on. Fortunately 'es learning the Kingdom way of dealing with a 
problem.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
What do you mean?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DUBAL:</font>
You'd think by meeting most o' the Tsurani that not one among them ever would laugh at anything,
least of all themselves. But I've 'ad some luck getting Sumani to have some humor about the
situation. In 'is own way, 'e's quite the joke teller.<p> 

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
You can't be serious. He's as jovial as a corpse.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>DUBAL:</font>
I'd not exactly say that, an' certainly not in so many words to his face. But go on, get 'im to 
tell you the joke 'e told me 'alf an 'our ago. I think it might lift 'is spirits a bit after
you've smashed them about. G'won. In the meanswhile, I think I'm going to 'ave me a quick smoke 
in quiet for a bit.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Might be worth a try. Thanks, Dubal.<p>

The dwarf frowned at them.<p>

Apparently resolute not to move from his stool for some time, he puffed heartily on his pipe.
"If you'd be ever so kind, I'd prefer it if ya left me unpestered. A dwarf's pipe is a religious
matter and a tavern his temple. Perhaps we can jabber a bit later."<p>
