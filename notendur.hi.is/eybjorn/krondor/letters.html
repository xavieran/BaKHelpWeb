DECEMBER 1998:<p>
This page was written ages ago. I haven't had time to
add any new letters for a long time, and really don't know if I ever will.
Currently I have approximately 8000 letters to consider! I have thought of
deleting this page, but since it contains a lot of interesting stuff, I think
it should stay. My apologies to the many who have written me interesting letters,
that really belong here. Perhaps, one of these days ...<p>
Most of the below derives from the early days of the Web, and is quite outdated.
I have added some comments, where needed.

<blockquote><b>
<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>This web rocks.</b>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>
<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>I just thought I'd let you know that this is without doubt one of the 
best web sites I have ever seen - an example of what can and should be 
done with the medium.</b>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>
<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>I just wanted to say what a fantastic site you have. A great page and
really good speed. I wish there were more like it. Please go on expanding this site.</b>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>
<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>Betrayal at Krondor is the BEST game ever. This Web Page has got to be
one of the very best most well done (sic) page I've ever seen. I will gladly add a link to it from my page ...
</b>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>
<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>
I would like to add my voice to many others who have praised your 
Betrayal at Krondor Web Page. It is one of the best, if not THE best 
Page I have seen on the 'Net in every way I can think of. I sincerely
hope that you're working on other pages as supreme as this one, most 
importantly for the forthcoming Return to Krondor (BAK2).
</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>
<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>
Betrayal at Krondor has got to be one of my all-time favorite games and 
is definitely my favourite RPG game. The combat is fantastic, the 
story is interesting and continues to amaze me, even if I'm playing it for the
third time! I do have to wait between replays, though, or otherwise I'd get bored.
</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>
<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>
Some people I've spoken to have complained that BAK was too linear and you 
couldn't change the storyline.  While I must admit this is true, there 
are loads of sub-adventures you can experience. I keep finding things I 
haven't done or seen before.  This game is truly fantastic!
</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>
<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>
Betrayal at Krondor is a really cool. Right now I am in Chapter 3. I've killed 
Navon Du Sandau, and I am fighting Moredhel Idiots, looking for the 
Nighthawk Headquarters. I really like it.
</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>
<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>
I just wish to thank you for an excellent Krondor-page. I started playing
BAK a few years ago, and finished it some months later. There was one thing
that kept annoying me, though. I couldn't find the
shell that repaired the Guarda Revanche. I was sure I had searched through
the entirety of Midkemia, killing every Moredhel, opening every chest. 
However I didn't find the Shell until I read your excellent Walkthrough. 
Thank you - your pages have lifted a severe burden from my shoulders. 
</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>
<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>
I just wanna let you know that BAK is definitely the best game
yet and your web-site absolutely kicks ass !!!
</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>
<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>
This is one of the greatest web pages I have ever seen. And I believe I've 
been around the Internet a lot.
</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>
<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>
The Krondor Web is the best!  It's phenomenal! It's so good, I had to stop
looking at it, or else it would spoil the rest of the game for me. Anyway,
I'm stumbling my way through Midkemia, some three years after I got this 
game (I was on hiatus for a while), and I am mighty pleased to see that 
there is such a comprehensive site for BAK. I dunno if I should be surprised,
because I still rate BAK as one of the top RPGs ever (Wiz7 gets the other vote),
and maybe it only makes sense that such a wonderful site would follow; at any
rate, you have one of the best sites I have EVER visited.  It's awesome.
</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>
<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>
This is an EXCELLENT web site. I admire your effort in producing it. It would be
nice if more sites could follow this model.

I am on the FEISTFANS-L mailing list, and I am a big fan of Raymond E. Feist.
I know I am not the first one to tell you that your page is truly excellent.
You deserve a pat on the back for all the work you've put into your awsome
page. There is only one thing wrong with it though - you are to modest! Put
your name on it in a couple of places - you deserve it. I mean, I had to go
to Kirk Woll's page just to find out your name! Thanks again for this great
page. Thanks to any who helped, also.</b><p>

interested in my identity, here's some information:<p><center>

I can't think of anything else! I guess I am modest, after all!<p></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>
<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>
I really admire your pages. Although I've not NEEDED to use them yet, I've
skimmed through a lot of them, and can really appreciate the vast amount of
work involved. I admire your dedication, and wonder at your motives for doing this.<p>
COMMENT: Re: motives. So do I - all the time!
</b></blockquote>
And finally, a negative comment:<br>
<blockquote><b>
<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>Found your page interesting, but the brown background and dark text made it
VERY hard to read (I'm using Navigator 1.1N).</b><p>
COMMENT: I was a bit puzzled by this letter. As I'm basically using bright
text (Green, Red, Yellow) on Black background, I wrote back asking for more
specific information. Unfortunately I never received an answer. Please let me
know if <b>YOU</b> have a problem reading the BAK Web!<p>
Unfortunately I don't have any more negative comments to report. I guess most people won't bother to express their opinion, unless
it's positive. If you don't like a page, it's all too easy just to forget about it. Although it is, of course, very nice to receive
a lot of positive feedback, I'm a bit disappointed by the lack of criticism. I am far from happy with some aspects of
the layout myself. But apart from that I am truly overwhelmed by all the positive feedback I've been getting. I just wish
I could make the BAK Help Web available to more people. I finally made it into the
Games Domain, but so far YAHOO have ignored my requests for inclusion, which is a
shame, because so many people use YAHOO.<p>

<font color=#999900>MUCH LATER: Most of this is, of course, no longer true. The Web has been
on Yahoo for quite a while, and I've actually received a few negative responses. I've even
received a couple of abusive ones, but only one obscene one ;-)</font><p>

Many more general comments will be found scattered below under various headings.</blockquote>

</blockquote>
ANOTHER LETTER:<b><blockquote><p>
First of all I would like to say that this is one of the most fantastic web sites
I've ever seen. I was browsing through your Correspondence Page and saw a request for
a downloadable version of BAK. I believe there's a shareware version at the following URL:<p>
http://happypuppy.com/games/link/betrayal.htm<p>
The page is called The Betrayal at Krondor Download Page, so I think it's a pretty
safe bet. I hope this helps in case anyone ever asks for the information.</b></blockquote><p>
COMMENT:<p><blockquote>
I am grateful indeed. But I don't think this is a FULL version of the game, though.
By the way, for all or any of you, who are interested in downloadable games, patches and
 things like that - the place to be is THE GAMES DOMAIN. They have EVERYTHING, even this
Web!<p>

<b>LETTER # 1:<br>

inn? Any help will be appreciated!</b><p></blockquote>
REPLY # 1:<br><blockquote></b>
Sorry, I can't help NOW, but I'll check when I get home tonight.
I've been meaning to collect the names of ALL the inns, maybe
one of these days I'll get around to it. You can be sure I'll
let you know immediately, if I can locate it. Do you have a
specific reason for wanting to find it? Are you expecting to
find something there? If so, let me know - it might help me
locating it faster.<p></blockquote>
LETTER # 2:<br><blockquote><b>
<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>Actually, I was told in Chapter 3 (after I went back to Krondor) by one
of the Mockers in the sewers that I'm supposed to look for Mocker's Rest
and ask about something. Can't remember what though.</b><p></blockquote>
REPLY # 2:<br><blockquote>
Mocker's Rest beats me. I'll keep looking. BTW, did you like my Web?

wrong with it. I need all the criticism I can get.<p></blockquote>

get any guff from me, dude.</b><p></blockquote>
REPLY # 3:<br><blockquote><p>
Been looking for Mocker's Rest. It's definitely NOT in any of
the cities or towns, so I guess it must be somewhere
in the middle of nowhere.
Please let me know the reason you think it exists
at all!<p></blockquote>
LETTER # 4:<br><blockquote><b>
<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>The mocker in the sewers said to drop by (in Chapter 3).</b></blockquote><p>
NO REPLY<p>
LETTER # 5:<br><blockquote><b>
<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>Hi and Happy New Year! BTW, have you found the Mocker's Rest yet?
</b></blockquote><p>
REPLY # 5:<br><blockquote><p>
Finally, here's your answer: You can not find Mocker's Rest. It is
the Mockers' meeting place in the sewers below Krondor. If you try 
to enter the sewers in any of the
Chapters where you're not allowed to, Limm will refuse you entrance 
to the sewers, because the thieves are having a meeting there!<p></blockquote>
LETTER # 6:<br><blockquote><b>
<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>Hmm ... went through the text of the game and the dialogue is in there. It 
mentions family business at the Mocker's Rest and to talk to someone or 
other. I think it's also specifically mentioned it's an inn. Unfortunately 
there's no location. No worries though, I'm still looking. I've been there 
before I just can't recall where. It might be in the woods somewhere far from 
everything else. Oh well. Thanx for the info though.</b></blockquote><p>
COMMENT: Sigh... For the interested: There is no Mocker's Rest Inn to be found
anywhere in the game. If you've read Feist's novels, you'll know why: Mocker's
Rest is situated in the Sewers below Krondor.<p>

<h3>RETURN TO KRONDOR (Sequel)</h3>
Go to <a href=#tab>Table of Contents</a><p>
Many people have asked about a SEQUEL:<p>
<blockquote><b>
<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>I really enjoyed playing BAK and I really appreciate your page on the Web.
There are a lot of side quests I didn't even suspect. By the way, do you
know when the sequel to BAK is due?<p>

<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>I recently bought a PC in August and one of the first games I bought was 
Betrayal at Krondor. I loved it. The first minute I started to play it 
I was hooked.  It's actually the only RPG I ever considered replaying.  
Since it says on the box that the game came out in 1993, I was wondering 
if you know anything about a sequel being released any time soon.<p>

<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>I've been playing Betrayal at Krondor for a long time and I
have always enjoyed playing it.
I was wondering if you know any other role-playing games as good as BAK,
which can be found in the market. I've tried to find games like this,
but they have not been as good as this one.<p></b></blockquote><p>
COMMENTS: Here's info on <a href="../../../external.html?link=http://www.sierrastudios.com/">7th Level's RETURN TO KRONDOR</a> (including graphics!)</a>
I have not yet found a game that comes close to BAK.<p>

<font color=#999900>MUCH LATER: By now, we have the unofffical sequel (Betrayal in Antara) and
the official one (Return to Krondor). See my <a href="links.html">LINKS</a> page for the relevant
links. We even have Feist's novelization of BAK, Krondor: The Betrayal!</font><p>

<h3>WINDOWS 95</h3>
Go to <a href=#tab>Table of Contents</a><p>
A very common problem:<p><blockquote><b>

<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>I have installed Win95 and the gane just does not want to work, saying
"NOT ENOUGH MEMORY - MAKE BOOTDISK" .... but I have 32 Megabytes of RAM!
I am desperate to play the game - tell me what I can do ...<p>

<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>Have you tried to play Betrayal at Krondor on Windows 95?? I am trying to,
but I can't get it to work.<p>

<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>Whenever I try to start up BAK in Windows 95 with

REPLY:<p><blockquote>                                  
Sorry, but I'm NOT an expert on these things. All I know is
that this is not a question of RAM at all. You must have at
least 590K of conventional memory free in order to run the
game.<p>

I've been able to run BAK under Windows 95, but only by 
creating new AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files, and booting
the computer using those. You have to pare these files down to
the bare minimum in order to free enough conventional memory.
If you can free about 600K, you should be all right. (I've managed
to free 612K.) You also need 1MB of EMS (Expanded Memory, NOT Extended
Memory), so a Memory Manager is needed.<p>

By the way, I had exactly the same problem trying to run BAK
under Windows 3.1! (I guess it's basically a DOS game.)<p>

As for SOUND, I can't offer any help at all. All I know is that when I first
got Windows 95, it refused to accept my Soundblaster. It finally turned out that
W95 didn't recognize the Soundblaster Driver (which was pretty old). After loading
a new version of the driver, everything was OK.<p>

If this doesn't work, I'm afraid I won't be much help.<p></blockquote>
COMMENT: Only one person with this problem has actually written back:<p><blockquote>
<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0><b>
Thanks for the info - I didn't know it needed 590K - so I just
freed up a lot of memory with QEMM. Thank you once again. Now I
can start my journey.</b><p></blockquote>
COMMENT: Strangely enough Windows 95 has made the BAK Help Web possible!
While I was still using Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups, I was unable
to screen-capture BAK graphics. To my surprise this is possible under Windows 95.
By the way: I'm sure some of you know all the answers to all the technical problems
associated with BAK. How about helping out? Send me your solutions, so that I can
include them in the BAK Web.<p>
LATER COMMENT: I receive many requests for help with Windows problems. Unfortunately
I'm not an expert on technical problems, but usually I've been able to help. I've
also received cries for help from people, who can't run BAK under DOS; people who
used to be able to run BAK under DOS, then lost their boot-disk and the instructions
for making a boot-disk! The following is basically my standard answer to all of you
who can't run BAK for some reason or other:<p>
Betrayal at Krondor is a DOS game. It MUST be able to access a minimum of 590K
Conventional DOS memory, and 1MB EMS. In most cases you will need to create a
boot-disk in order to achieve this. Instructions on how to do this are included
in the BAK package.<p>
If you want to run the game under Windows (95 or earlier), you basically must boot
your computer with the boot-disk, before running Windows. After that you're just
running BAK in a DOS Window.<p>
Here are some instruction on creating a BAK boot-disk:<p>

Copy your autoexec.bat, config.sys and command.com files to a diskette.
Pare down autoexec.bat and config.sys to the bare minimum. Make sure the
following lines are in your config.sys:<p>
device=c:\dos\himem.sys<br>
device=c:\dos\emm386.exe 1024 ram<br>
dos=umb, high<p>
Also make sure that your mouse driver and soundcard driver are loaded
into high memory (example: devicehigh=c:\mouse\mouse.sys).<p>
After booting up with the boot-disk, check your memory (using the MEM
command). If you now have 590K (or more) conventional memory, and 1024K
EMS, you should be able to run BAK. If not, you'll have to remove more stuff!
If you're running SMARTDRV.EXE, it is OK to remove this.<p>
You could also try to run DOS's MEMMAKER. This program is quite intelligent,
and can easily reconfigure your system.<p>
WARNING: Always make copies of your autoexec.bat and config.sys before you
start messing with them!!!!<p>

<font color=#999900>MUCH LATER: This continues to be a problem, but unfortunately
there is no single solution. The problems and the solutions totally depend on the
configuration of the computer you're using. I've recently needed to install BAK 
under Windows 98. It refused to run, until I set the sound to "Soundblaster/AdLib" in the INSTALL
program. After that, it ran OK, regardless of the 590 K limit.</font><p>

<h3>FINAL REST</h3>
Go to <a href=#tab>Table of Contents</a><p>
This one went on for a few weeks, and is a bit embarassing for me, as I was
totally unable to give any help at all, until it was too late.<p>
LETTER # 1:<p><blockquote>
<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0><b>Where do you find the FINAL REST Spell?</b></blockquote><p>

Don't hesitate to ask whenever you need. I may not always be able

LATER REPLY:<p>
<blockquote>
Sorry - still haven't found the FINAL REST - beginning
to doubt if it's to be found in Chapter 2. That only leaves
Chapter 3. I'll keep my eyes peeled - I know it's gotta be there
somewhere, because I found it once - although I've totally
forgotten where! Just be patient - that is in case you haven't
found it yourself already.</blockquote><p>

the need arises.</b></blockquote><p>
REPLY # 3:<p><blockquote>
I know this is too late for you, but you may be interested
to know that
FINAL REST can be found in Chapter 2. If you visit Brother
Marc (in the cornfield south of Sarth) in this Chapter, his
NIGHTHAWKS keyword will be switched on. Marc will tell you
all about Nighthawks and Black Slayers, and offer you FINAL
REST for 100 Sovereigns.</blockquote><p>
LETTER # 4:<p><b><blockquote>

I appreciate the help. Thanks.</b></blockquote><p>
COMMENTS: At the time I still hadn't even started investigating the Chapters in question, so my
help amounted to less than nothing. However, without this correspondence I would probably NOT have
made a special effort to find Final Rest, thus discovering Brother Marc's offer. A good example of the way
the Web has benefited from feedback. Write, all of you!<p>

<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>
Congragulations on your Betrayal at Krondor homepage stuff. It must have
taken a lot of effort to do.<p>

Since you seem to be the authority on B@K I wanted to know if you could tell
me where I can find the MIND MELT Spell in the game.
I have played the game twice and am pretty sure I've looked in all the Moredhel
Chests,  etc.
Where is it ?</b></blockquote><p>
REPLY:<p><blockquote>
Hmmm - a very good question indeed! I've never really used the MM spell,
so I had to check some of my old saves. This is what I found:<p>

Owyn never seems to have found this spell.

Patrus has this spell at the start of Chapter 7, but he doesn't
have it at the end of Chapter 5. Very strange indeed .....<p>

I'll investigate this further when I have the time, and let you
know if I find something. At the moment I'm spending all my
time trying to finish the Chapter 3 Walkthrough.<p>

One possibility is that Patrus automatically has MM at the beginning
of Chapter 7. My saves certainly indicate that this is the case. Do you have any saves where you could check this out?
</blockquote><p>
MUCH LATER:<p>
<blockquote>It has finally been pointed out to me where Patrus can get the
MIND MELT Spell. In Dencamp there's a house you can't enter unless you have the
correct password. In another house a man will tell you the password, which turns
out to be wrong. However if you return to the man, he will now give you the correct
password. You can now enter the house, and get MIND MELT. Of course Owyn can also
get this spell, if he goes to Dencamp during Chapters 1 - 3. MIND MELT doesn't
look like much of a spell, but it should be noted that it does Double Damage to
both Goblins and Witch Hags. A good authority on BAK has assured me that a MIND
MELT at a Cost of 9 points will suffice to kill ANY Witch Hag in the game!<p>
Weirdly, (I'm told) you can only do this in the original version of the game. In version 1.2
the man will not be in the house the second time around, so you're unable to get
the spell.<p></blockquote>

he can use it at his own leisure at home. Thanks a lot for putting all files Krondorian
in the same directory. I sincerely hope you don´t mind my stealing it. My brother (more

Glad you appreciate my efforts. Of course you're more than welcome to download the whole

appreciates your patience. You give the concept of Brotherly Love a new meaning. I just hope
you don't have a boss peering over your shoulder at work!<p>
There is a catch, though. I'm constantly adding bits and pieces to the BAK Web, mainly as a
result of all the correspondence I receive. Also I'm working on some new features which may
(or may not) be added in the near or distant future. So make a note of the latest revisions
date - when this changes you may want to download new versions! I try to mention any revisions
in the Updates Page, and you'll probably be able to figure out which files have been changed.<p>
Your brother's comment on Makala and the Beasthounds is interesting indeed. I haven't tried it 
out, as I don´t have a proper SAVE for it. I'm a bit surprised though, because generally I've 
found the Beasthounds' performance to be rather poor. Does your brother have any detailed info
on this? Do Beasthounds do extra damage to Dreads? To Makala? My preferred method, which involves
a combination of TOUCH OF LIMS-KRAGMA/SKIN OF THE DRAGON/FETTERS OF RIME, may be too elaborate (?).
If there's a "simple" solution to the Makala Fight, I would be most interested to know about this.

Well, the main thing about the Beasthounds is that they're pesky, annoying

You are quite correct that they are neither extremely tough nor
kickers of rears in close combat - sorry if I made you believe otherwise!

ANOTHER LETTER:<p>

You wondered about the Beasthounds' prowess against Makala. I tried this the other
day, and they ARE somewhat effective. Their attacks are pitiful, but they serve
another purpose. If you get 5 or so Beasthounds running around, they will clog up
Makala's and the Dreads' Spells, as the Spells will often hit the Beasthounds instead
of your Characters. Therefore you can just whack them with Spells yourself without
worrying much.

<h3>LYSLE RIGGER and THE RIFTWAR SAGA</h3>
Go to <a href=#tab>Table of Contents</a><p>
LETTER:<p><b><blockquote>
<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>
This web page is great! Even more thorough than Yee's Strategy 
Guide. A great page for a great game. Anyway, I need some help and I'm 
wondering if you can help. In the Strategy Guide there's a list of things
you have to pay for (like training), where it says you can hire Lysle Rigger
to impersonate you (for 100 sovereigns). When and where does this happen?! All I can talk to him about 
is the hand he sold. I've done like everything there is possible in the 
game BUT that one little thing. HELP!<p> 

P.S. Have you read all the books? They're great! So great I'm now in 
the process of re-reading all of them! The game is so much better after
reading the books because people you talk to usually refer to book
characters in passing and its like "oh yeah I remember that guy!" : )<p>
</b></blockquote>
REPLY:<p>
<blockquote>
Thanks for the flattering comments on the BAK Web. As regards your Lysle
Rigger dilemma, I'm afraid I can't help at all! As a matter of fact I think
it's extremely unlikely that you can do such a thing. What would be the purpose?
Although the Survival Guide is very helpful, unfortunately it's riddled with
errors. I suspect this may be one of those.<p>
As for the books - yes, I've read them all (except the latest one, which is not
yet out in paperback). I think they're very good indeed, although I don't think
I would want to actually re-read them. Of course this is a matter of taste - I
just happen to be more into stuff like Stephen Donaldson and Robert Jordan. But
I agree that when you've read the books, the game gains a whole new dimension.
I should know, because I hadn't read them, when I first played the game, but did
so while I was creating the BAK Help Web. It really casts a totally new light on
the game. I never cared much for James when I first played the game, but then he
turned out to be my favorite character in the books! In some cases, though, the
knowledge from the books clashes with the game. For example, I find it very hard
to believe that Limm (in the Krondor Sewers) can teach James anything about Stealth!
If the game were completely in accordance with the books, James' Lockpicking and
Stealth Skills should be much higher than they are! But this is nitpicking of the
worst sort, so I'll stop now ...</blockquote><p>

Eliaem is just standing there on the riverbank for all to see!

On the Western Path go to where it bends furthest towards the

You sure have a problem there! As this has never happened to me

I can only think of one thing: If your characters' inventories
get filled, any overflow will go into a bag. Have you checked
whether there is a bag on the ground with the shell in it?
If not, all I can suggest is that you play this part of the game
all over again. (Hope you have a handy SAVE!) This time go and
talk to Eliaem FIRST to accept the Quest. THEN fight the Spellcaster
to get Eliaem's Heart. FINALLY go back to Eliaem and give her the
Heart. She is definitely supposed the give you lots of Rations AND
the Shell.<p>
I think it is quite possible that you have to talk to her first
in order to accept the Quest before you perform it.<p>
If none of this works, I am quite at a loss!!!<p></blockquote>
LETTER # 3:<p><blockquote><b>
<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>
I've found out how to get Eliaem's Shell. You must drop the Hilt of the
Guarda Revanche into a bag before talking to Eliaem. If Gorath or Owyn
hold the Sword, the program will not give you the Shell. This must be a 
bug ... <p></b></blockquote>
REPLY # 3:<p><blockquote>
Glad you managed to solve this riddle? Surely it's a bug - I guess
the game just doesn't expect you to find the Hilt BEFORE you get the
Shell.<p></blockquote>
COMMENTS: Actually the game has a few minor bugs of a similar nature.
These basically happen, if you do things in an order not expected by
the game. One typical example comes from Chapter 2: Lord Lyton's Quest.
If you are already carrying 6 suits of Standard Kingdom Armor, when you
first speak to Lord Lyton, you won't be able to give them to him. You
must drop them in a bag BEFORE you speak to him and accept the Quest,
go back and fetch the armor, and then go back to his house. Silly, isn't
it?<p>
MUCH LATER: I finally succumbed to the temptation, and tested this. And managed
to solve the problem. And what a silly little bug it turned out to be! In order
to receive Eliaem's Shell, Gorath and Owyn must, between them, have 3 empty slots
in their inventories before they hand over the Heart. Why? I'll try to explain:<p>
Eliaem will give them 12 packs of Rations and the Shell, i.e. 13 items. In order
for all of these to go into their inventories, Gorath and Owyn need 13 empty slots
between them. (No, the slot just emptied by giving the Heart to Eliaem will not get
filled.) If the inventories are full, Eliaem's gifts will go into a bag. The problem
is that the bag only has 10 slots, so 2 of the Rations, and the Shell, will disappear
into programmer's oblivion. If you have 3 empty slots in the inventories, 3 Rations
will go there, the rest (9 Rations and the Shell) into the Bag. (If you only have
two empty slots, 2 Rations go into inventory, 10 into Bag, and the Shell is lost.<p>
I don't know what the programmers can have been thinking about! It should have been
easy to ensure that the Shell replaced the Heart in inventory.<p>

This is a well known bug in the original version of the game. I believe
it has been fixed in later versions. The bug has to do with the Guarda
Revanche Sword, so basically it will only happen in Chapters 8 and 9.
If Gorath uses the sword on some enemies, they will actually GAIN Health
Points instead of losing them. Unfortunate, isn't it? I know there's one
Moredhel Warrior in Chapter 9, and at least two Pantathians in Chapter 8,

The SCENT OF SARIG Spell only allows you to detect the trap. The Game

deactivate the trap. Basically what you need to do is to raise your
Lockpicking Skill. Always keep your Picklocks in the possession of the
Character with the best Skill. Use any opportunity to practice your
Lockpicking - your Skill will increase with each attempt. Abuk (whom
you'll find East of Lyton) can improve your Skill a lot, for a fee.
Please note that some chests may be impossible to deactivate.

What an awesome page! I was reading the section on Weapon & Armor
Modifiers when I noticed your comments on Flaming Swords. I've always
wondered about that. I happened to look in a book on BAK I have, and
found it has some weird info on Flaming items. (BTW, this book is full
of errors.) It refers several times to an item called a Fire Brand, which
has something to do with Crossbows. It also vaguely mentions an item called
a Quegian Fireball which, as far as I could tell, is a Flaming Sword Modifier.
It also has a list of spells with no descriptions, including a spell called
SEEK NOT THE HEAT, which obviously (maybe?) doesn't exist. Judging by the
name of this spell it sounds like it might protect you from Flamed Swords ...
This book also states that wearing the Amulet of the Upright Man not
only increases your lockpicking skills but also protects you from the
Nightfingers Spell! I don't know about you, but I have never had anybody 
even <b>try</b> to cast NIGHTFINGERS on me.<br>
Finally: Have you ever cast NIGHTFINGERS on Makala? He is carrying a
Steelfired Staff. I wonder how he pulled that one off!!

REPLY # 1:<p><blockquote>
Thanks for a very interesting letter! I hardly know what to say about
this esoteric information ....<p>
I still have no idea whether it's at all possible to Flame

this book you're talking about? Surely it's not Yee's Survival
Guide? Please let me know - I didn't know there was another

He also mentions Firebrands, which I think are = Flaming Quarrels.
A Quegian Fireball?? Oh my .... I seriously doubt such a thing
exists. SEEK NOT THE HEAT sounds interesting as well, but I'm
practicaly 100% sure that doesn't exist either.<p>
I think it's quite likely that the Amulet of the Upright Man
does give protection from Nightfingers, but as you remark, I

<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>
Thanks for the response.  I'm sure that a Quegian Fireball and SEEK NOT THE
HEAT do not exist but I wonder why my book talks about it?<p>
I'd better explain: The book I get all this bogus (?) information from
isn't really a book. I have the CD version of BAK, which has an online
Hint program on it.  That's where I got all this info.<p>  
Flaming weapons sounds like something that the programmers put in the game
but never really did much with and finally just phased the idea out.
I once saw some screen shots from BAK that looked rather
different.  From what I could tell, it was an earlier version of the game.
I guess they came out with a version with bug fixes soon after
that.  The screen shot I saw was of a battle, but the buttons at the bottom
were arranged in a totaly different pattern.<p>  
As for Firebrands, my "book" says that they are REQUIRED IN ORDER TO
shoot Flaming Quarrels, whereas in Yee's book they are obviously THE SAME
AS Flaming Quarrels!<p>
I bet all this stuff (Firebrands, Flamed Weapon Modifiers, SEEK NOT THE
HEAT, Quegian Fireballs, etc.) was actually in the original version of 
the game.  When they fixed the bugs, they also got rid of a lot of stuff,
and perhaps added stuff as well and changed some names. (For example, as
you mention in your Spell Pages, Strength Drain is also called Life Drain.)<p>
My book refers to the Aventurine as Cleaning Oil! It doesn't
even mention the word Aventurine. It also states that you can purchase a
Staff of Macros at Dabeh's Fanciful Trinkets.  Furthermore it has some
Spell information that doesn't make any sense.  It says HOCHO'S HAVEN can 
only be cast upon the caster himself and that SKIN OF THE DRAGON can only 
be cast on someone other than the caster.  It also says you can't have more 
than one Mirror Wall active at a time, and that a Staff of Macros is 
required to cast MAD GOD'S RAGE!<p>
All of this could possibly be part of an earlier version of BAK. Tell me
anything else you know. Hope this info helps. What we need to do is somehow
contact Sierra and ask somebody who REALLY knows!

Sigh! It really looks as if I have to get the CD-version, if only for the

I must confess that these days I usually turn the music OFF whenever I need

after six months of sessions lasting up to 8 hours, I began to fear for my
sanity. During the last two months I even began to suspect that the structure
of my inner ear had become irretrievably <b>MUTATED</b>, because I could actually
<b>HEAR</b> the music for hours after I'd turned off my computer, especially in bed after
turning off the lights, and sometimes even in the morning on waking up! This was
especially true of the Northlands theme in Chapter 4, and the Rift-World theme in
Chapter 8. To top it all, BAK's Combat Theme is the one I like least of all, and
today I can barely listen to it without flinching. Enough said.<p>
BTW, I'm ashamed to say that I've only ever played one version of BAK (the 1993
diskette version). I know there's a CD version, and I also know there are patches
available to update the original version. Does anyone out there have partial or

<h3>MAKING MONEY IN ROMNEY</h3>
Go to <a href=#tab>Table of Contents</a><p>
LETTER:<p><blockquote><b>
<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>
In Romney, at the start of Chapter 3,
the Guild War prices mean that you can sell all sorts of junk there for
massive prices! When carrying equipment to Romney, if you find yourself
a bit short of space, and feel like cheating, the Cheat Central Chest can
be used as an extra backpack. Just empty it and fill up the space with
valuable stuff. You don't have to keep all the stuff from the Cheat Chest
(just throw it away), but the extra space can be very valuable, and if you
feel guilty about cheating, you can view it as simply saving time.
</blockquote></b><p>
ANOTHER LETTER:<p><blockquote><b>
<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>
I was very surprised to see that nobody seems to have discovered 
a great way of making lots of money at the beginning of Chapter 3. 
The best thing about it is that it's not a bug or a cheat, even 
though some people might consider it a less than ethical avenue.<p> 
At the beginning of Chapter 3 the city of Romney is under civil unrest 
and, consequently, the prices have gone through the roof, especially for 
weapons and armor. I discovered that, unlike any other time in the game, 
the trafficking of materials is a profitable venture at this time. I 
found that I could make the most money by going immediately north out of 
Romney until reaching the temple of Banath. I would then teleport to the 
temple of Tith, which I had visited in Chapter 2, and enter the 
Arms of Dala Shop in Wolfram. As you know, this shop sells damaged goods at 
cut prices, so I could buy them cheaply and repair them, improving my 
skills in the bargain. The easiest things to carry and the most 
profitable are the Greatswords, which I bought until I filled my 
inventory. The road back to Romney is just routine and the rewards at the 
end are overwhelming. Using this method I amassed about 20000 sovereigns.
I could have "earned" much more, but there was no need for it.<p>
It is important to do this before contacting Arlie Steelsoul, as this 
will end the rioting and drive the prices back down.

If you really want a way for Owyn to be able to defeat 
Makala and the Dreads on his own, one way is to increase his strength 
enormously using the Magical Fountain on the way to Elvandar.  If you 
bring enough Fadamor's Formula, and give Owyn one vial at a time while 
Gorath holds the rest, you can boost their strength as much as you want.

REPLY:<p><blockquote>
This is very interesting indeed. I haven't managed to test this yet,
as I don't have a handy save for it. If I understand you correctly,
you can repeat the action while your supplies of Fadamor's Formula
last, boosting the Strength again and again. This is then similar to
the two instances where you can get the same money endlessly (i.e. the
Inn at Tanneurs and the plague-house near Lims-Kragma). I've often
wondered if the programmers designed it that way, or if they are
accidental oversights (more likely).

ANOTHER LETTER:<p><blockquote><b>

In Chapter 6 (Elvandar) there is a Magical Well that will increase 
your strength if you drink from it, mixing Fadamor's Formula with 
the water as you drink.  However, a bug in the game (I'm guessing) makes 
this Well the ultimate power-up.  The game never decrements your supply 
of Fadamor's Formula!  Your characters can have 200+ strength in no time at all!
Chapter 8 has never been so easy.

COMMENT:<p><blockquote>
I must admit I kind of skimped when I wrote the Northern Elvandar part of
the Chapter 6 Walkthrough. I DID come across the above mentioned Well, as
you can see from the Elvandar Map (it's there!), but since I didn´t have
any Fadamor's at hand, I didn't bother (for shame!) How could I have 
suspected that my oversight would later be spotted by eagle-eyed users of
the BAK Web, which at that time was only a distant dream?<p>
Anyway, I stand corrected. The problem is that I don't have a handy SAVE
to check this out - can anybody help? Unfortunately I've thrown away a
lot of old saves (making room for new ones), and I don't want to replay
Chapter 6 from scratch. If anybody can E-mail me a Zipped Save (right in
front of the Well, plenty of Fadamor's provided) I would be extremely
grateful for the time thus saved.<p>
I don't want to add details to the Walkthrough until I'm able to experience
this particular feature, but a hint has now been added to the Chapter 6
Walkthrough.

LATER COMMENT:
<blockquote> Yes, I finally managed to make my way to the Magical Well
with a supply of Fadamor's Formula in order to test the Strength-Boosting
feature! I tested the Well's features in all possible ways, and here's what
it does in my version (obviously other versions differ!):<p>
The following procedure can be repeated as long as there is any FF. Each
successful use of FF will add +3 Strength to both Characters.<p>
<ol>
<li>If Owyn has any FF, all will be taken. Strength = +3.
<li>If Owyn doesn't, Gorath's supply is checked. Then:
<li>If Gorath has any FF, all will be taken. Strength = +3.
</ol><p>
Thus the only way of using each charge of Fadamor's Formula here, is
to let Gorath hold all and feed one at a time to Owyn. This way the Well
will only use one FF at a time. This concurs with the first letter above,
so I queried the info from the second letter. Here's the reply I received:<p></blockquote>
STILL ANOTHER LETTER:<p><blockquote><b>
<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>
This is truly weird. I purchased my copy, on floppies, only a few months
ago. I discovered the Well and associated bug the second time I played through the game.
I did, however, download a patch for BAK from Software Creation BBS. You can
Telnet to swcbbs.com or hit www.swcbbs.com on the Net. If you do a zippy file
scan for "betrayal at krondor", it has a patch, from Dynamix originally, that 
upgrades the game to Version 1.01 (I think). I can not verify that my
original Version 1.0 diskettes did this Strength Bug, but the game most assuredly
did this after the upgrade, so I can only assume that the upgrade may have
introduced the bug into the game. If you would like, I could send you a saved
game, so you could verify it.<p>
I am in Chapter 9 at the moment, crushing everything in my path. This is
much easier than the first time - Chapter 8 took me 20 minutes - when I ran
and hid all the time because I was injured and LOW on food. If no one else
can verify this bug, I can only continue to utilize it myself. However, it is
very real, and reproducable from a save I made at the beginning of Chapter 8. 
I had had the same result several times, and I checked again to verify my
sanity after receiving your E-mail.</b></blockquote><p>
REPLY:<p><blockquote>
Can you send me a SAVE? Preferably right in front of the Well (before use if you can),
with plenty Fadamor's Formula provided? I have NOT downloaded the Patch, but
I want to try this out in my un-patched version. I'm pretty certain this
bug can't be duplicated without the patch, but I just want to make sure
this isn't happening on account of an item you're carrying, or anything like
that. I have recently come across a bug, which I was able to reproduce in
my version of BAK by using somebody else's Save, so I wan't to make sure.</blockquote><p>

REPLY:<p><blockquote>
It is a bit difficult for me to advise you, not knowing exactly
what the situation is. I suspect you're not doing this right.<p>
Check out the following:
<ul><li>
Make sure your characters' health/strength points are as
high as possible. If not, use restoratives. (You can also
use restoratives during battle.)
<li>
Make sure your weapons/armor are fully repaired, and use any
modifiers and/or potions you have.
<li>
Try to keep Owyn away from enemies, so he can use his spells.
What spells do you have? Perhaps you need more? You can buy
a lot of spells in Sarth. Don't you have any money? Remember
you can sell weapons/armor from dead enemies in most shops.
<li>
If an enemy is a spellcaster or an archer, you can disable him
by having one of your characters stand next to him. Always try
to kill spellcasters/archers first.
<li>
If you "die" you can get healed at the nearest temple (if you
can pay). You can also heal yourself with Sleep and Herbal Packs.
Use Herbal Pack before sleeping, but take care that you stop
sleeping before the Pack runs out. Repeat as necessary.
</ul>
I hope some of this helps. If you play the game correctly, it is
possible to kill all enemies. But it is very important to use
every opportunity to improve your skills. I'm sure you'll get the
hang of this soon (read the manual carefully).

REPLY:<p><blockquote>
The Tuning Fork can be found in various places, and bought
in some shops. I can't remember all of them, but here are two of
them (both mentioned in the Chapter 2 Walkthrough):
<ol><li>
In Chapter 2, as you approach Malac's Cross from the west,
you will meet a group of 4 Nighthawks. One of them has a Tuning
Fork.
<li>
Please read the GRAIN QUEST section in the Chapter 2 Walkthrough.
You can get a Tuning Fork from Larissa (east of the Temple of Dala).
If I remember correctly, the first group of enemies east of Larissa's
house also have one.
</ol>
For your information - when I first played BAK, I managed to finish
it, without even knowing what the Tuning Fork was for!! I remember 
trying to use it on the Practice Lute (!), and then I guess I just forgot
about it! TROLLS are truly nasty, but they're also rather stupid,
so they can actually be defeated, if you try hard enough. Just
remember to SAVE before you fight them, and try repeating the fight
until you're successful. You'll soon get the hang of it (Spells are
important here). The downside is that they rarely carry anything
worth having - although I vaguely remember a Troll or two that actually
had something worth taking.

positive aspects of Damage at 3x the Cost and No Line of Sight! Plus,
as far as I know, it does Double Damage to Witch Hags, i.e. a MIND MELT
of Cost 9 will kill any Witch Hag you encounter.
<li>THE CD VERSION OF BAK. I have recently bought the Sierra Originals
edition of BAK on CD. As you already know I'm writing from Germany, so
this is the German Language Version. It has the CD Audio Tracks and the
AVI with the Feist interview, BUT IT DOES NOT USE THE CD AUDIO IN THE GAME!
Actually, as concerns the GAME itself, it's an exact copy of the normal
German disk version to the very byte! They didn't even fix the spelling
error in the krondor.001 file that wouldn't let you open on of the Moredhel
Chests near the Dimwood Rusalki.<p></ul>

excellent web site!

REPLY # 1:<p><blockquote>
Thanks indeed for your letter - the information is much appreciated. You
are in no way pestering me - as a matter of fact your letter has excited
my curiosity. Firstly, your observation about MIND MELT is absolutely correct.
I had already realized MIND MELT does Double Damage to Goblins, but the Witch
Hag factor brings it up a notch. How frustrating that this spell can only be found
in one place! (Or am I wrong here?) What really interests me is the German version of BAK - do they
really translate names like Highcastle? Also I'm puzzled (and curious) about
that spelling error you mentioned. Any info on a German Midkemia would be
appreciated, if you have the time.<p></blockquote>
LETTER # 2:<p><blockquote><b>
<img src="tinynote.gif" width=44 height=26 border=0>
Before replying to your letter, it seems I've bumped into one of those tiny
annoying bugs in BAK, making it impossible for me to finish the Alcohol Quest
in Capter 6. Some time during Chapters 1-3 I visited the Secret Valley and
opened all the Chests there. Trying to temporarily get rid of some items, I
crammed all the Ale Casks into two of the Chests, and transferred a lot of
things from Inventory to other Chests. In Chapter 6 ALL THE CHESTS are empty!<p>
You've expressed interest in the German nomenclature for BAK. Yes, they really
translate Highcastle. Here's a short list from memory:<p>
<table border=0>
<tr><td><b>Highcastle<td><b>Hohe Burg
<tr><td><b>Eldpoint<td><b>Altwinkel
<tr><td width=200><b>Dencamp on the Teeth<td><b>Dencamp auf den Z&#228;hnen
<tr><td><b>Dimwood<td><b>Hogewald
<tr><td><b>Hawk's Hollow<td><b>Falkenh&#246;hle
<tr><td><b>Sloop<td><b>Zille
<tr><td><b>Northwarden<td><b>Nordwacht
<tr><td><b>Questor's View<td><b>Questor's Sicht
<tr><td><b>Darkmoor<td><b>Finstermoor
<tr><td><b>Prank's Stone<td><b>Schelmenstein
<tr><td><b>Kenting Rush<td><b>Kenting H&#246;he
<tr><td><b>Cavall Keep<td><b>Cavall Hort
<tr><td><b>Nalar's Rib<td><b>Nalar's Rippe
</table><p>
Some translatable people's names got translated as well: Mitchell Waylander
is Mitchell Wegl&#228;nder, and the German equivalent to the Halfgate Sisters
is "die Halbtor Schwestern".<p>
Oddly enough Malac's Cross ("Malac's Kreuz") didn't get translated, and neither
did Abbot Graves ("Abt Gr&#228;ber").<p>
All Spells (with the exception of NACRE CICATRIX) got translated as well. Most
other places and people have kept their names.<p>
Finally, they of course translated all the Moredhel Chest Riddles. The error
you've asked me about is in the BELL Chest (N. Section of Dimwood). The correct
German answer is "GLOCKEN", but there's no "C" on the fourth letter wheel, making
it impossible to open this Chest!<p></b></blockquote>
REPLY # 2:<p><blockquote>
In reply to the first part of your extremely informative letter (your failed
Alcohol Quest): I don't really think this can be classified as a bug. As you
know, anything left in a Bag can easily disappear (realistically). A Chest used
as a Bag is no different - things can be stolen from this as well. As soon as
you've messed with a Chest, it's just the same as a Bag. I've heard of a patch,
though, which you can download from somewhere, which (among other things) makes
it possible to store things in Moredhel Chests, without the possibility that they
will be stolen. I think I downloaded this patch once, but it did things to my
BAK that I didn't like. As for the Alcohol Quest - I don't know if this will be
of any use - you can buy an Ale Cask in Loriel. Could this be the loophole you need?<p>
As for the rest - I enjoyed it immensely! Languages, and translations, are of special
interest to me. Happily I know enough German to be able to understand and appreciate
the German variants of the names in BAK.</blockquote><p>

there in Chapter 7. (I hope this works!)<p>
The main reason I'm writing, though, is that I've encountered a weird situation
during Chapter 6.  After meeting Eliaem and solving her Quest, I wasn't able to
carry all the Rations she gave me, so I put most of them (along with a couple of
useless things) into a BAG. After exploring the Green Heart some more, I returned
to this BAG to stock up on my Rations. The BAG still held all the Rations and Items
I'd put there, BUT it also contained two extra Items: a 165% Medium Crossbow, both
Poisoned and Flamed (not possible!), and a BIG YELLOWISH THING that took up four
space units (like an armor), was Blessed and NOT THERE: Investigating it (Right
Click) resulted in an empty message, and trying to drag it into Inventory simply crashed
the game! <p>
Also, your BAK Web shows the Guarda Revanche to be Blessed (#3). In my game (remember
this is the German version!) it does NOT carry any Blessing. Do I need to go
somewhere in order to receive a Blessing?</b></blockquote><p>
REPLY # 3:<p><blockquote>
Easy things first: In my version of the game the hilt of the Guarda is definitely 3xBlessed
when found, and keeps the Blessing throughout the rest of the game. Sorry!<p>
As for the weird Items in your bag, I am horribly interested. Could you send me
a Saved Game?

Re: the Guarda - I suspected this! Re: the Bug Bag - 
I've tried to access the Bag again, but the game just crashes!! If I can find
a way of sending you a Save (in front of the Bag), I will do so tomorrow.

COMMENT: <p><blockquote>
My correspondent kept his word and sent me a zipped save. After experimenting
with the Bug Bag, I decided it was interesting enough to create a small Page
around it, rather than just publishing my reply on the current page. There's a
riddle included for you to solve. So here it
is:<p><center><a href="bugbag.html">The German Bug Bag Page!</a></center></blockquote><p>
EXTRA COMMENT: <p><blockquote>
My German E-pen pal has reported other frustrating experiences with his version of the
game. If you think a Non-Blessed Guarda Revanche is the ultimate bummer, how about this:<p>
In Chapter 8 you can find three suits of Valheru Armor (Bless Type #3). Not so in the German
version! Here there are only two of them (Bless Type #1) Aarghhhh ....!<p>
We want more BUGS! If you've found one, how about sharing it with the rest of us?<p>

<font color=#999900>MUCH LATER: The "German" bug described above, is actually a version 1.02
bug. See the MAP WEB. Various impossible items turn up randomly in the Bug Bag, but the above
example is the only one, known to me, where a non-item turns up.</font><p>
