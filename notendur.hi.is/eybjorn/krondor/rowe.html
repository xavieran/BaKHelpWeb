A farmer was ahead of them.<p>

Debating for a moment whether it would be more prudent to hide before they were seen or to 
behave normally, Locklear decided that the man was probably of no immediate threat to them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ROWE:</font>
I hope for your good health that you have found shelter against the coming tempest, good
sirs.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Tempest?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ROWE:</font>
Surely you have heard. The learned monks of Sarth have predicted a terrible storm is coming
this way and I would hate to think of anyone caught out in it. Why a man could catch his death 
of the fevers. If you would like, you may ride it out in my barn.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
And what profit would you turn in this enterprise?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ROWE:</font>
Five golden sovereigns, a reasonable sum, and the guard over my cows. You can sleep in the hay 
loft of my barn but my wife and I don't take in elves.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Seven gold pieces, the elf stays with us and we each get a hard roll for breakfast.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ROWE:</font>
Ten gold and the lot of you milk cows the next morning. That's the offer. Take it or leave it.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ROWE:</font>
Why hello again. Have you reconsidered my offer for lodging?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Reconsidered yes, but I haven't come to a decision. The price is a bit steep.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ROWE:</font>
Eight gold, then and you won't have to watch over my cows. How does that sound to you? I cannot 
in good conscience come much lower than that.<p>

Deal. Where is this barn of yours?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ROWE:</font>
Keep heading south - you should pass the Abbaye of Ishap at Sarth. You'll know you're right 
close to it when you've passed up the Temple of Sung. From there it's just around Yellow Mule 
mountain. When you find the barn, just go knock on the door and my wife will fix you up.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Thank you, farmer. Your hospitality will be remembered.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
You'll have to forgive me, but I'm afraid I've misspoken myself. I don't have the money to pay 
you.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ROWE:</font>
Do you think you're likely to have any soon?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
I can't be certain. We should be going anyway. Good day to you.<p>

I think we'll try our chances on foot. Good day to you, farmer.<p>
