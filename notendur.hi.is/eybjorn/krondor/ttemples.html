The colonnade was typical.<p>

Like most of Midkemia's places of worship, the temple's exterior was devoid of 
any kind of adornment that might be carried off by wandering thieves. "I would 
really like to know why it is that the priests who design these Temples can’t 
see fit to let someone know what god or goddess is being worshipped inside," Locklear
growled. "Would a sign really be too much to ask for?"<p>

Incense swirled.<p>
Striding between the columns of the temple, Locklear made for the heavy wooden doors
which had been sealed against the daylight and which preserved the privacy of any ceremonies
in progress. Pulling a tasseled rope which hung next to the door, he awaited the response of
the door warden...

The temple doors were barred.<p>
Stepping away, Locklear shrugged his shoulders. "I suppose even priests require sleep from
time to time," he said. "We may have to wait until morning before we can get an audience
with anyone."

The meditation chamber was Spartan and strangely cold, seeming all the colder 
for the heatless flame which burned in the holy censer. The only bow that had 
been made to adornment in the temple appeared to be the strange pattern that had 
been etched upon the wall.<p>

The fire was <i>cold</i>.
Unnerved by the unnatural flame, Locklear decided to explore elsewhere.<p>

Locklear squinted. 
No matter how he looked at the picture, it didn't seem to represent anything in 
particular.<p>

Locklear squinted.
The wall looked strangely barren, as if a space had been prepared for a 
decoration which had not yet been crafted.<p>

<blockquote>

The design was odd.<p>
"I see the mandala interests you." Turning, Locklear noticed a thin young man standing 
in the archway, his hands hidden in the folds of his robe. "While the relations 
between the temples and the new Academy of Magic at Stardock have been cool, it 
is one of the treasures they have passed on of the Tsurani magic. It has given 
us great mobility."<p>
"Mobility?" Locklear asked. "How can a painting help you move?"<p>
The acolyte smiled. "It would be easier to explain by example. Tell me about a 
place you are familiar with, a place where you have spent a good deal of time."
Locklear shrugged, describing the place he had grown up, the layout of the rooms, the 
various things associated with his home.<p>
"Very good," the man replied. "As you described those things to me, doubtless 
you also experienced certain memories through which you were able to relive your 
past. In the same way, these mandalas help us locate a place. By memorizing a 
pattern painted on the wall of a specific temple, we may will ourselves there."<p>
"I could think my way home with this?"<p>
"No. The memory of your home would be too unfocused for you to make the attempt. 
But, if you were to memorize this pattern, you could return here by recalling 
its image in your mind when assisted by the power of another Temple."<p>
Locklear looked back at the mandala, lost in thought for a moment, his eyes soaking up 
the intricacies of it. "I assume there would be some fee associated with moving 
between locations?"<p>
The acolyte nodded. "As simple as it is in concept, it still requires a great 
deal of effort to move even a single individual, though I am told the Tsurani 
Great Ones move about with less effort. I believe Pug wished to restrict our 
knowledge of this in some ways until we had proven we would not abuse its 
power."<p>

A priest approached.<p>
His dark robes rustling as he crossed into the meditation chamber, he came to a 
halt behind Locklear. "I sensed that someone studied the mandala. Am I to assume you 
wish to call upon the powers of the Temple?"<p>
"Perhaps," Locklear said. "I would like to ponder my options first."<p>
"Certainly," the priest replied. "If you will allow me, I will alert the required 
brethren while you make your choice. Should you decide to summon the mandala, I 
will collect the fee at that time."<p>

A bell sounded.<p>
Abruptly a darkly robed priest swept into the room and came to a halt behind Locklear. 
"I was alerted that you might desire to use the mandala."<p>
"Desire, perhaps, but I haven't seen any of the other symbols," Locklear said. "I 
don't suppose you could go with us?"<p>
"I am regret that I cannot assist you," the priest said. "My duties require I 
stay here to guide others that wish to arrive. I am sorry."<p>

The priest chuckled.<p>
Perplexed by what the darkly robed acolyte suddenly found so amusing, Locklear arched

bit disoriented. The mandala you wished to be transported to is right in front 
of your face. This temple."

Locklear recalled the mandala.<p>
Like a wheel of fire, it exploded across Locklear's consciousness, vanquishing the 
world in a searing blaze of white light. For a heartbeat all that existed in 
universe was a single point of rotating fire, spun by an unseen hand with 
incredible power. Spun by the hand of a god.<p>
Locklear blinked. As abruptly as it had burst into existence, the mandala was gone, 
replaced by a simple painting upon a temple wall. A new temple wall. Nearby, a 
clutch of darkly robed acolytes waited, their faces registering neither shock 
nor fear at the sudden arrival.<p>
"You knew we were coming?" Locklear asked, stepping away from the symbol.
"As a courtesy, we are given some warning by the sending Temple," one of the 
priests said. "You will likely feel a little disoriented for a time, but the 
sensation should pass. Be welcome."<p>

The curtains seemed to lead to an inner sanctum.<p>

Locklear pulled the curtains aside.<p>
The rear section of the temple was as dramatic as was the meditation chamber; a 
large pool occupied the center of a lush courtyard and was hemmed in on all 
sides by an alabaster peristyle with climbing vines. Cloistered immediately off 
the open area were several arches, doorways either blocked by heavily woven 
curtains or choked with clouds of obscuring incense.<p>
Nearby, a gong sounded and immediately a priest hurried out of a doorway, 
halting as he caught sight of the unexpected supplicants...

The priests bid them farewell.
Leaving the lushness of the central courtyard, they passed back through the

The priest shook his head.<p>
Twice he had examined everyone from head to toe, but apparently he had found

over him, other times in which he lapsed into fevered dreams filled with 
nightmarish creatures.<p>

Locklear searched his pack.
"Which of your items would you like blessed today?" a priest asked.<p>

A priest accepted the item.<p>
Carefully, he laid the [Item] on a low table covered with a white cloth while he 
opened a book which he retrieved from a cluttered bookshelf. Flipping through 
its tattered pages, he found a column of numbers and ran his finger down them.<p>
"I've always wondered why the price of a blessing varied from item to item," Locklear 
said, watching the priest. "Does it have something to do with the gods?"<p>
"Rather more to do with how the item was made," the priest explained. "If there 
are any special metals used in its construction or spells used to bend the 
metal, then they become factors in how difficult it will be for us to make a 
blessing stick." Leaning closer to the page, he stabbed at a figure. "Ah! Here 
it is... for your [Item], it will be [x] sovereigns," the priest said.

Locklear waited.<p>
Far off, he could hear the low chanting of the priests in their alcoves, their 
prayers weaving the fabric of the enchantment. It seemed the better part of the 
day had passed away as he listened to the sonorous whispers rising and falling 
in the near dark. Suddenly, the doors to a great chamber were thrown open and 
the priest emerged, the blade/armor laid in his arms, swaddled in a white cloth.<p>

place upon the Great Wheel bids you."

Locklear handed over the item.<p>
While the priest scurried off with the [Item], he looked over the tapestries of the 
Temple's inner sanctum. Several of them looked to be hundreds of years old, 
their religious themes fraying or threadbare, patched in humble earnest by 
weavers far less accomplished than the original makers.<p>
"I regret that your petition has been refused." Startled, Locklear turned to find that 
the priest had returned, a frown etched on his face. "It may not be blessed. For 
whatever reason, it has been deemed... inappropriate." 

</td><td valign=top>
<b>

Locklear presented the [Item] to a priest.<p>
Running his hand over the metal, the young man frowned, then glanced up at Locklear. 
"This has already been favored by the gods. If you wish, I may remove the 
enchantment upon it, but you should know the potency of an enchantment varies 
between temples. It may be that our blessing would be less effective."<p>
"How so?" Locklear asked.<p>
"It has to do with the nature of the gods. The deities who are counted as more 
forceful have the strongest enchantments; these would be Lims-Kragma, Kahooli, 
Dala and Tith. After them come the moderate gods; Killian, Silban, Ruthia, 
Banath and Astalon. The rest of the gods and goddesses seem to be more passive 
when it comes to human affairs and their blessings tend to be less effective. 
While I cannot be sure which of the temples have placed their blessing on this 
weapon, I still may remove its enchantment. Do you wish for me to do so?"

They were shown to a chamber.<p>
Here, there were no flagstones or chipped tiles underneath their feet, but 
instead a thick carpet of grass jeweled with dew. At the far end of the room, a 
pair of yew trees overarched a throne of woven reed, upon which was seated a 
striking looking woman, her shoulder length black hair bound behind her back 
with a green cord.<p>
"I am the High Priestess of this Temple," she said musically. "Killian welcomes 
you to her domain. Come. Be seated."<p>
Listening with keen interest to the stories told by Locklear, the priestess remained 
as motionless as a statue. At last, she folded her hands in her lap and sighed 
heavily.<p>
"That was most entertaining," she said. "I particularly liked the part about the 
drunk. But I would advise you in the future to keep an eye on the food you eat. 
You shouldn't simply gulp down the first thing you find without taking a look at 
it first."<p>
Properly chastened, Locklear shrugged his shoulders and promised he would be more

Acolytes escorted them.<p>
After passing through a maddening series of arches, they finally were let into 
a large chamber upon whose floor a seven rayed star was formed in mosaic by dark 
blue tiles. A small priest stood in the symbol's center, his back turned towards 
them.<p>
"We are looking for the high priest of this Temple," Locklear said. "Would you know 
where we could find him?"<p>
"I am he." As the man half-turned, Locklear suppressed a gasp at the priest's hideous 
visage. Stuck to the left side of his face was a dark brown strip of cloth, a 
ragged hole torn in it to allow a pinkish looking eye to peer out at them.<p>
"What is it that you want?" he wheezed, his frame shuddering with each breath. "Are you new
acolytes?"<p>
"No." Locklear swallowed with some difficulty. "We are...travellers."<p>
"As all under the heavens are," the man said, making a feeble gesture at the 
vaulted ceiling above them. All travellers. Please, let us talk a while."<p>
When at last many of the candles in the chamber had burned low, the priest 
nodded his head. "I have enjoyed this," he said quietly.<p>
"As have we," Locklear replied graciously, rising to leave. "Oh, before I forget, 
where was the interesting statue again that you mentioned?"<p>
"The oracle? In the hills to the east of Malac's Cross," the priest replied. "Perhaps your
journeys will take you there soon."<p>

The priest stared at them.
His eyes much like guttering candle flames, he leaned against the wall of the 
temple for support. "I cannot help you, not now. Not until I can get some 
sleep," he murmured. "Sleep..."<p>

<font color=#cc0000 size=+1>TALK:</font><br>

Locklear asked to see the high priestess.<p>
"She can't see you." Turning, they noticed another, hawkish looking priest 
half-hidden in the shadows of the colonnade, his eyes rimmed red. He rubbed 
vigorously at his face before rising to stand next to his fellow priest. "Mariah 
and I just put her abed about half an hour ago. She awoke screaming this 
morning."<p>
The two priests exchanged a significant look, but the meaning of it was lost on 
Locklear. "Is she ill?" he interrupted.<p>
"No, no." the taller priest said with assurance. "It is only a symptom of things 
that have been going on here for a short while. It will pass."<p>
"You sound very certain, Kellan," the other priest said angrily.<p>
"None of us has slept well in weeks. Our healer is so exhausted that he may not 
even bind so much as a finger pricked on a spindle! There is something evil at 
work here."<p>
Bemused, Locklear looked to Kellan. "Why would someone be trying to keep you from 
sleeping? Who could do it?"<p>
Both priests shrugged. "The purpose is beyond us, but we know that whomever is 
responsible is a magician and very close by," the shorter priest replied. "I 
have also sensed in his dream sendings that he has others with him, soldiers 
perhaps. I don't actually believe he means to communicate with us, but instead 
with someone far away. Either way, I don't believe any of us shall have an 
hour's rest until he is dead or we've discovered what he wants."<p>

<font color=#cc0000 size=+1>REVISIT (Nago dead):</font><p>

Kellan greeted them.<p>
"You look a little more lively than the last time we met," Locklear said. "Have you 
gotten a bit of rest?"<p>
"The first I've had in a while," the priest admitted. "As I suspected, the 
dreams plague us no more. I've even heard our healer is once more on his feet. 
Our high priestess is still tired as yet, but I assume she will be back about 
her duties in no time. Things return to normal as by the will of Sung..."<p>
Gorath hissed through his teeth at the bowing priest. "Like all priests, you 
credit those who watch and not those who do."<p>
Snapping abruptly upright, a hurt look glowered in Kellan's eyes. "What do you 
mean?"<p>
"He means," Owyn interjected, "that we found the person responsible for the dream 
sendings. There was a moredhel magician and we took care of the problem."<p>
Sensing that the boy might go too far in his glory hounding, Locklear seized Owyn's arm 
in a tight grip. "Please forgive my companions for their outbursts. They have 
been on the road for quite some time and have forgotten their manners."<p>
"No apology is necessary," the priest said, removing Locklear's grip on Owyn's arm. 
"They are quite proper in asking acknowledgement. How may I reward you?"<p>
"Do you have any spells I might learn?" Owyn interjected. Seeing the anger 
flaring in the seigneur's eyes, he quickly amended, "If there are other 
magicians like them, it might be prudent for us to be better prepared to meet 
the challenge."<p>
Kellan nodded. "I have one such spell I can teach you that will allow you to 
protect yourselves. If the others will stay here?"<p>
Fuming, Locklear nodded his reluctant assent, taking a seat next to the reflection 
pool, motioning for Gorath to do likewise. Wordlessly, both sat down and 
prepared for a long wait.<p>
After several hours Owyn returned, a light smile flickering on his lips, 
but in the intervening time, Locklear's anger had not abated. Thanking the priest as 
graciously as he could, Locklear turned and stormed from the temple's courtyard, 
his charges following quickly behind him.<p>

<font color=#cc0000 size=+1>FIRST VISIT (if Nago already dead):</font><p>

Locklear asked to see the high priestess.<p>
"She can't see you." Turning, they noticed another, hawkish looking priest
half-hidden in the shadows of the colonnade, his eyes rimmed red. He rubbed 
vigorously at his face before rising to stand next to his fellow priest. "Mariah 
and I just put her abed about half an hour ago. She awoke screaming this 
morning."<p>
The two priests exchanged a significant look, but the meaning of it was lost on 
Locklear. "Is she ill?" he interrupted.<p>
"No, no." the taller priest said with assurance. "It is only a symptom of things 
that have been going on here for a short while. It will pass."<p>
"You sound very certain, Kellan," the other priest said angrily.<p>
"None of us has slept well in weeks. Our healer is so exhausted that he may not 
even bind so much as a finger pricked on a spindle! There is something evil at 
work here."<p>
Bemused, Locklear looked to Kellan. "Why would someone be trying to keep you from 
sleeping? Who could do it?"<p>
Both priests shrugged. "The purpose is beyond us, but we know that whomever is 
responsible is a magician and very close by," the shorter priest replied. "I 
have also sensed in his dream sendings that he has others with him, soldiers 
perhaps. I don't actually believe he means to communicate with us, but instead 
with someone far away. Either way, I don't believe any of us shall have an 
hour's rest until he is dead or we've discovered what he wants."<p>
Seeing that Locklear had suddenly grown silent, the priests asked what was the matter. 
Quickly Locklear explained about their encounter with the moredhel spellcaster Nago 
and the fact that he was very probably the cause of their previous distress.<p>
"But this is wonderful news," Kellan said, clapping his hands. Things will 
improve here once we have all gotten our sleep. Perhaps our healer is already 
rested. He might be able to bind your wounds if you were injured."<p>
"We shall also see you rewarded," the other priest insisted, despite Locklear's 
persistent shaking of his head.<p>
"Do you have any spells I might learn?" Owyn interjected. Seeing the anger 
flaring in the seigneur's eyes, he quickly amended, "If there are other 
magicians like them, it might be prudent for us to be better prepared to meet 
the challenge."<p>
Kellan nodded. "I have one such spell I can teach you that will allow you to 
protect yourselves. If the others will stay here?"<p>
Locklear nodded his reluctant assent, taking a seat next to the reflection pool, 
motioning for Gorath to do likewise. Wordlessly, both sat down and prepared for 
a long wait, chatting wearily with the other priest of Sung.<p>
After several hours Owyn returned, a light smile flickering on his lips. "A 
wonderful spell," he whispered in Locklear's ear. "I can't wait to try it out in 
practice."<p>
"Don't be too eager," Locklear shot back. "I'm not quite in the mood to run across 
another moredhel any time soon."<p>
Thanking the priests for their kind reward, Locklear turned and escorted his 
companions out of the courtyard.<p>

<font color=#cc0000 size=+1>SUBSEQUENTLY:</font><p>

Fire was everywhere in the Temple.<p>
In braziers, in pits, in censers; flame seemed to the principle decoration in 
many of the chambers they were led through on the way to the high priestess. 
Though by all rights Prandur was the proper god of fire, Locklear mused that Sung 
could easily claim a right to it by the way her priests and priestesses adorned 
her temple.<p>
At last they were admitted to a large circular chamber ringed by flaming torches 
and in which the high priestess was kneeling at an altar of flawless white 
marble. Rising, she turned to face her guests and dismissed the acolytes who had 
brought them.<p>
"High priestess," Locklear said with a respectful bow. "We have been on the road for 
many days and merely wished to express our homage to the goddess. We are in need 
of whatever luck we might find and whatever wisdom."<p>
A faint look of distress appeared in the woman's green eyes. In reply she said 
nothing, keeping her gaze fixed intently on Locklear's face.<p>
"Have we given offense?" Locklear asked. "Transgressed in some way?"<p>
Again the priestess said nothing, but touched a hand to her lips and then to her 
ear, giving the sign that she was mute. Understanding, Locklear bowed again to her and 
begged forgiveness. "We shall trouble you no further."<p>

<font color=#cc0000 size=+1>FIRST VISIT:</font><p>

A priestess escorted them.<p>
Expecting a chamber in keeping with the rest of the grandeur of the Temple, Locklear
was startled when they were led into a cramped room where an old woman sat 
reading through a sheaf of papers. Glancing up, the high priestess squinted at 
them, then shook her head.<p>
"You will excuse me, but I was expecting someone else," she said, laying aside 
the papers she had been reading. "A few days ago I sent a summons to one of our 
faithful, a Franklin that lives to the north of Eggley."<p>
"I doubt he would have been able to get to you," Locklear replied. "We ran into a 
band of men just outside the temple who seemed bent on killing any that came up 
the road."<p>
The priestess exhaled loudly. "The Quegian fever is spreading here, and likely 
those were more men infected with it. If you were to go to him and tell him the 
way is clear, I would consider it a very great favor." Looking back down at the 
tracts scattered in her lap, she rubbed at her eyes. "You'll forgive me, but I 
really must get back to work on these. Please see yourselves out. Goddess'
blessing on you."<p>

<font color=#cc0000 size=+1>SECOND VISIT (if not Devon):</font><p>

Locklear requested an audience.<p>
After several minutes of waiting, a plump woman dressed in brown robes appeared 
in the courtyard, a quizzical look etched on her face as she hurried across the 
flagstones. Glancing at Locklear, she arched an eyebrow. "You are the father of the 
child?"<p>
Locklear blinked. "I'm no one's father as far as I'm aware, but..."<p>
"Then why in the sweet goddess' name are you here?" the woman asked, blinking 
furiously as beads of sweat trailed into her eyes. "I've got four exhausted 
acolytes and a terrified woman who we aren't sure will make it through birth. 
Then I have a priestess come running and telling me that a lord is demanding an 
audience. Did you just decide to drop in and chat?"<p>
Turning red, Locklear tried to make amends. "I didn't really mean to..." But before he 
could finish, the priestess was storming back across the courtyard.<p>


<font color=#cc0000 size=+1>SECOND VISIT (if Devon):</font><p>

A messenger went to find the high priestess.<p>
In a few moments, a tall, proud looking woman limped from under one of the 
arches, her long grey hair hanging lank around her face as a plump woman 
trundled at her side for support. When Locklear hailed them, the shorter woman wheeled 
angrily. "The high priestess has been through a terrible ceremony," she snapped. 
"She has no time for..."<p>
"Belandra!" The high priestess jerked her arm from her assistant's grasp, 
silencing her with a cold stare. "I am neither so old, nor so ill in the 
goddess' favor that I cannot spare a moment to speak with these gentlemen. If 
you were to remember the spirit of our catechisms more often than their letter, 
I think you might replace me someday. Our place is in service to both the earth 
mother and those who worship her. Remember."<p>
Locklear bowed his head. "That is very gracious of you, high priestess, but if another 
time would be more convenient..."<p>
The old woman chuckled darkly. "Speak, noble one."<p>
Sensing that brevity was in his best interest, he quickly related the things 
Devon had told him during their visit to the Stranger Tavern in Eggley. When, at 
last, he had finished, a grave expression was on the high priestess face.<p>
"There is no curse upon the town, whatever this man Devon may have told you," 
she said. "But we share fault in this. The ritual of the Festival never was 
intended like this, and now it has brought shame on this Temple and misery up on 
our faithful of Eggley. Never more shall there be a Festival..."<p>
Belandra gasped. "High priestess! the Festival..."<p>
"Silence, child," she said, turning her glare on Locklear. "I will also see this 
Collector brought to justice! If you can find him, send him to us with word that 
we have a reward to give him. I will see you very well remunerated for your 
efforts. Goddess' blessing on you."<p>
Turning, the high priestess moved across the courtyard, followed quickly after 
by her plump assistant.<p>

<font color=#cc0000 size=+1>COLLECTOR NOT FOUND:</font><p>

Locklear sent for the high priestess.<p>
After only a brief pause, the woman appeared in the courtyard, thankfully 
without the company of her plump assistant.<p>
"As you have returned so early, I must only assume you have found the 
gentleman named the Collector," she said quickly. "Is it so?"<p>
Locklear shook his head. "We have not met face to face as yet, but..." Holding up a 
hand, the high priestess shook her head. "No excuses. I shall see you again once 
you have sent him to us. Goddess' blessing on you."<p>

<font color=#cc0000 size=+1>COLLECTOR FOUND:</font><p>

A messenger went to find the high priestess.<p>
In a few moments she appeared, her grey hair floating behind her as she greeted 
her guests. "On behalf of the Earth Mother, we thank you," she said. "The man 
who called himself the Collector is now in our custody."<p>
"What will become of him?" Locklear asked.<p>
"He will learn what it means to anger a goddess," she replied. "After, if he 
still lives, we will see he is rehabilitated."<p> 
Locklear shivered as he contemplated the future that likely lay ahead for the 
criminal. In the few instances he had seen a convicted heretic punished, he had 
been forced to avert his eyes. Hesitantly, he cleared his throat. "I believe 
there was some mention of a reward?"<p>
The priestess nodded. "I have arranged for a few healing potions to be given to 
you as well as a small sum of gold. You will have them before you leave the 
Temple. I must leave you now to begin dispensing justice on this Collector. 
Goddess' blessing on you."<p>

<font color=#cc0000 size=+1>SUBSEQUENTLY:</font><p>

They waited.<p>
After an uncomfortably long wait, the high priestess' plump assistant emerged 
into the courtyard, her face high with color.<p>
"The high priestess sends her regrets that she cannot come at the moment," 
Belandra said with a respectful bow. "She is otherwise occupied. She sends her 
thanks and her gratitude for having helped us in the past and asks that you 
forgive her this discourtesy. Goddess' blessing on you gentlemen."<p>

The priest motioned for them to follow.<p>
Although the temple was smaller for its housing within Krondor's palace, 
it was far more richly adorned than many of the other places of worship in 
Midkemia. Where others used woven curtains or tapestries to divide rooms, there 
were often richly carved doors here, sometimes with religious themes, other 
times with scenes of life in Krondor.<p>
When at last they had reached a small room, the priest followed them in 
and closed the door. Turning, he looked as if he were waiting for Owyn to do 
something.<p>
"Are you going to get the Lector for us?" James asked, feeling 
uncomfortable.<p>
"I am the Lector," the man explained, smoothing the folds 
out of his sky blue robe. "Were you not aware that Father Timothy died recently? 
I am his replacement sent from Rillanon. Father Francis at your service."<p>
James nodded and offered his apologies about the mistake. "We were 
hoping you could offer us a bit of advice on something." As quickly as 
possible, he attempted to explain their situation as the Lector listened 
patiently.<p>
"I don't know how Astalon might help you in this situation," the 
priest admitted after a brief moment of contemplation. "I wouldn't even know 
where we might begin. You would perhaps do better seeking advice from Prince 
Arutha or his assistants on this matter."<p>

Four times they had asked one of the temple's golden robed priestesses to send 
for the high priestess, and four times they had been left waiting in the alcoves 
of the temple's central courtyard. When at last it became apparent that their 
repeated summons were not going to be answered, James shook his head. "We don’t

There were no walls in the high priestess' chamber.<p>
James struggled to imagine how any such room could fit within the confines of the 
Temple, seeming as vast as any river valley through which he had ever passed. 
Even more startling had been the winding maze-like corridors the death acolyte 
had led them through to reach the room.<p>
"Few rush to speak to our lady. I am curious to know why you wish to converse 
with us." the high priestess said softly. A gauzy black pavilion draped her 
throne, obscuring from view all but her lithe form limned in witchlight and a 
single pale foot which she rested upon a skull carved of onyx. "Why do you call 
on the Drawer of Nets?"<p>
Seeing no point in lying to her, James shrugged. "Curiosity, as much as anything 
High Priestess. I wished to learn a little more about what awaits me when I am 
no longer living and you, short of the Mother Matriarch in Rillanon, are 
probably the one with the best answers. I do not like surprises."<p>
"Unless you are prepared to devote your life to her services, I cannot help you. 
It is not something I may merely unfold for you in an hour or an afternoon," she 
said. I will say this. There is no joy or love in her realm, but neither is 
there sorrow or pain. You have nothing to fear of her unless you swear the oaths
of a Nighthawk."<p>
"Why? What would that mean?"<p>
"Pain everlasting," the high priestess replied. "Those who are Nighthawks have 
sworn a dark oath, and those of them that are known as the Black Slayers swear 
the darkest oaths of all, allying themselves to other gods or goddesses who 
would hold them free of the portal of death at the price of their souls. Once a 
man becomes a Black Slayer, he may only be called into her halls by an 
invocation of Lims-Kragma herself, the Prayer of Final Rest."<p>

The hour was sounded.<p>
Clapping his hands over his ears, James looked resentfully up at the brass bells as 
they passed underneath them, mourning the fact that he hadn't a bit of beeswax 
to block out the clanging noise. If the priest leading them took any notice, he 
made no sign.<p>
The Lector of the Temple of Banath greeted them at the door to his study, a 
greying man with rounded features who patted each on the back as they passed 
inside to his study.<p>
"How may the Servants of Banath be of service?" he asked.<p>
"I'm not certain," James said, taking a seat by the window. "We have a difficult 
journey ahead and I was hoping that perhaps your god might have some insight 
into our predicament."<p>
The priest motioned for him to continue. Quickly James related most of their tale, 
with Gorath breaking in occasionally to correct certain inaccuracies.<p>
When the tale was, at last, finished the lector was squinting at them. "I am not 
sure of how we could be of assistance to you," he said. "It is the place of the 
temple to give aid when possible, but it seems as if many of the things you are 
having difficulty with you have brought on yourselves or are matters that are 
beyond the reach of what I may do for you. I am sorry."<p>

A scream echoed in the temple.<p>
Alarmed, James made to find the source of the shout, but a robed priest halted him 
by laying a hand on his chest..." Do not be alarmed by the sights and sounds you 
find in the Temple of Kahooli," the priest said calmly. "Know that justice is 
being dispensed within our halls."<p>
Still shaken by the sound, James looked to the priest. "What of our request to see 
the lector?"<p>
"He is busy at the moment," the priest said. "I am afraid he cannot see you 
today."<p>
Another scream rang through the courtyard.<p>

<font color=#cc0000 size=+1>CHAPTER 3:</font><p>

They were escorted to the lector's chambers.<p>
Seated behind a large mahogany desk was a man of middle years, the hair greying 
at his temples, sweeping back from a wide tanned forehead. Without standing he 
motioned for them to take seats.<p>
"I have very little time this morning," the lector said. "Please make whatever 
request you have as direct as possible."<p>
"That suits me fine. We're looking for a band of murderers, James said. "They 
killed a squad of men sent from Bas-Tyra on the First Adviser's orders to in 
vestigate the possible activities of Nighthawks in Romney. The idea occurred to 
me while we were standing in the meditation chambers the Temple of Kahooli might 
know something of it."<p>
"I am listening," he replied gravely.<p>
"When I was studying under Father Timothy in the Temple of Astalon in Krondor," 
James said, "I learned quite a bit about the various temples and their gods. As 
I recalled, Kahooli is the god of revenge..."<p>
"Justice," the lector snapped. Not revenge. If one is innocent, he has nothing 
to fear from The Howler After Fugitives. If one has violated the wise strictures 
of our gods and eluded punishment, however, we are the hounds that bay at his 
heels. There is no place one can run to that we cannot sniff them out."
James nodded. "A well known fact. But it is also well known that the Temple of 
Kahooli hires assassins on occasion to do the sniffing."<p>
"If you imply that we hired the Guild of Assassins to kill the men in Bas-Tyra, 
it is not so. We have had no dealing with the Hawks of the Night for several 
months. It may well be that we have common cause at the moment." The priest 
stopped for a moment as if considering something, then continued slowly. "They 
have become churlish. They no longer follow the codes of piety which we lay out 
for the behavior of our faithful and they have not paid a tithe in a great deal 
of time. We wish to separate them from our ranks, but... No protectors of the 
faith will challenge them."<p>
James leaned across the desk. "I want the Nighthawks, Lector. Tell me the name 
of the man who leads them and where he may be found and we both can profit from 
an end to them."<p>
The lector laughed a dark, rumbling laugh that had nothing of humor in it. "I 
wish that it were that easy. Kahooli, how I wish. But when the Nighthawks swore 
their oath to the Temple, they required of us a holy oath - to Kahooli himself -
that their identities could never be revealed to any that were not of the 
Temple itself. You would have to be at least protector of the faith before I 
could even think of giving the name of whomever you seek."<p>
"I see." James sat back in his chair, his eyes full of brooding. "How would we 
become protectors?"<p>
"You would have to study with the Prelate who lives nearby and learn the codes 
of piety," the lector said, a clever smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. 
"Though I will warn you, his house is well protected. There are many who do 
perceive us as the dispensers of revenge and attempt to save themselves 
peremptorily. I will say this - if you can come to the Temple and have performed 
even one of the acts of piety that the Lector teaches you, I think I can see to 
it that you a remade protectors of the faith."<p>
"And you will tell us where to find these Nighthawks?" James asked.<p>
The priest smiled. "Most certainly."<p>

<font color=#cc0000 size=+1>CONDITION NOT MET:</font><p>

The lector agreed to see them.<p>
Sipping from a steaming cup of tea, he looked critically across the desk at 
them. "The men looking for the Nighthawks," he said. "I am glad to see you once 
again, but as yet, you cannot be inducted as protectors of the faith," the 
lector said. "You must perform one of the acts of piety. There is simply no 
other way that I can help you. The laws of our Temple are very specific and 
binding."<p>
"Which act would be best?" James asked, at a loss to know what to do.<p>
The lector shook his head. "It is not a question of best or easiest. These 
things vary from person to person, though many may find that one or another 
option simply may not be open to them through conflicting oaths or practicality. 
Again I say to you, go and visit the Prelate. He is the only man that will be of 
any use to you in this. He lives very close by."<p>

<font color=#cc0000 size=+1>CONDITION MET:</font><p>

James stumbled.<p>
Cursing oaths that seemed far from appropriate within the hallowed temple walls, 
he followed the priest robed in light grey. Behind him, Owyn and Gorath seemed 
similarly pained, but all made it well enough to the lector's study.
Pushing their way into the oak paneled room, they took their seats and waited.<p>
In a few moments, the lector arrived, arrayed in his dark robes of office. 
Looking at all their faces, he nodded with a certain grim satisfaction. "You 
have chosen the mortification of the flesh," he said. "An admirable act of 
piety. It is enough."<p>
James nodded. "Good. Then tell me about the Guild of Assassins."<p>
"In a moment." Stepping back to the door, he whispered to the priest who waited 
outside. Footsteps hurried off into the distance. "Haestan will bring rations 
for you. You will be of little use against Navon and his band without your 
strength."<p>
James sat forward in his chair. "Navon who?"<p>
"Navon du Sandau," the lector said, emphasizing each syllable. "He lives here in 
Kenting Rush, poses as a travelling merchant. That gives him the excuse he needs 
to cover the strange visitors he has from time to time. He leads the Nighthawks, 
but the time has come for the end of the Guild of Assassins."<p>
"Agreed," James said, wobbling to his feet. We appreciate your help."<p>
"Wait." The lector leveled a stare at them. "As Kahooli has come to your aid, as 
protectors of the faith, you must now aid us. It is your responsibility now to 
slay him. His is excommunicate of the Temple of Kahooli. His life is forfeit."<p>
"You didn't mention this in the bargain before," James said. "Shall we be 
expecting other demands of you later?"<p>
The priest shook his head. "Only this. You may do as you please thereafter, 
though I would warn you always to tread carefully from this day forth when 
dealing with Kahooli. You are now, in our eyes, the arm of The Tireless 
Pursuer."<p>

Battle standards floated over their heads.<p>
Escorted into a room which looked more like a king's banquet hall than a 
sacred chamber, James feasted his eyes on the hundreds of war banners and shields 
which were hung on the walls. The room's most prominent feature was a long table 
which stretched the length of the torchlit hall and was covered with statuettes 
which looked like soldiers.<p>
A priest sat at the far end of the table, rearranging a cluster of the 
bone figurines that were before him. Larger than even Gorath across the 
shoulders, the Father Patriarch looked as menacing a figure as any that James 
had ever seen.<p>
"This looks like a war council," James observed, noting many of the 
figurines lay on their sides.<p>
"Of a sorts," the Patriarch said without looking up. Scratching at his 
grey streaked beard, he moved another piece, but seemed unsure of its placement 
as if he were moving it on someone else's advice. "Here, however, I merely 
observe. Others plan this battle."<p> 
"Whose battle?"<p>
The Father Patriarch glanced up, his wolfish eyes fixing on them. "Hmmm? 
This battle? It unfolds in the south of Kesh, near the Confederacy. I fear that 
the Empress Lakeishas forces are far superior. Her dog soldiers will crush the 
rebellion soon, I should think."<p>
James nodded as he looked over the lay of the battlefield. "How do you know 
where everyone is? Does Tith tell you?"<p>
The priest shook his head. "If the war god wished to tell me, it would 
take all the enjoyment out of making my guesses. I have messengers arriving 
daily to tell me how things transpire." Thumping the hardwood table with his 
fist, he looked at another group of figurines and moved to rearrange them as 
well. "Sometimes I am surprised."<p>
"I see. I don't suppose you could tell us about what the moredhel plan in 
the North, could you?" James asked, a little nervous about the presumption.<p>
"No," the priest replied. "I would be greatly interested, but all those 
messengers of mine that I have dispatched to check have been killed. Since I 
have less priests than I have curiosities, I decided to wait until I had either 
more of one or less of the other."<p>
Suddenly another priest appeared at the door to the chamber and hurried 
over to whisper in his superior's ear. Cursing, the Patriarch thumped the table 
again. "I have other things I must attend to," the priest said gruffly as soon 
as the other priest had scurried away. "I would offer you some Redweed Brew, but 
I have none to offer you, so you will have to find some elsewhere. Good day, 
men."<p>

James asked to see the high priestess.<p>
The attendant priest escorting them rattled like a great knight, a broadsword 
belted at his hip and his head covered in chain link underneath his hood. They 
passed other priests in the temple who were similarly attired, the whole of the 
religious order seemingly geared for a great battle.<p>
When at last they entered a small room, the burly priest nodded towards a large 
paper triptych which stood near the rear wall. "High priestess Risa will see you 
after she has attended to the sick one. I will return after your business is 
finished."<p>
A small whimper came from behind the shadowed screen but was quickly shushed by 
the high priestess. After a few moments, a lightly robed figure moved out from 
behind the screen, a bowl of gruel clutched between her small hands.<p>
"High priestess?" James ventured.<p>
Seeing James's surprised look, the woman smiled. "Let me guess. I am not as you 
expected. Many of my faithful think I have talons, eyes of fire and a sword 
sheathed at my hip." Moving to a small table, she set aside her wooden bowl and 
spoon, snatching up a towel to wipe broth from her hands. "People misinterpret 
Dala's role in the balance of things. While she guards those in battle, she also 
guards travellers as they sleep and looks after those in need. At the moment, I 
would value far more a bag of grain than I would all the martial skill in the 
world."<p>
James blinked. "Why is that, high priestess?"<p>
"Our stores are nearly empty," she replied. "What food we haven't given out to 
the poor has been stolen by thieves who have taken advantage of our generosity. 
If we cant get any grain to be milled so on, we will have to turn away children 
who have no other source of food."<p>
"We might be able to bring you rations..."<p>
The high priestess shook her head. "You can't store rations, not for long.  We 
need a bag of grain. In exchange, I think Dala might bestow you a boon, though I 
can't presume upon the goddess' favor without consultation. I would speak to you 
more, but I have others I need to see today."<p>
"I understand," James replied. "Thank you for your time."<p>

<font color=#cc0000 size=+1>GRAIN NOT FOUND:</font><p>

The priest asked them to follow.<p>
Instead of leading them to the small room to which they had been shown on their 
last visit, he instead admitted them to a private garden in which the high 
priestess Risa sat waiting next to a reflection pool.<p>
"Have you found the grain we need?" she asked.<p>
Taken off guard by the terseness of the priestess' question, James shook his head. 
"We haven't found any grain in a form you could use. We were hoping that perhaps 
you would have some ideas about where we could find what we need."<p>
Accepting this, the priestess pulled her knees up to her chest. "Look for any of 
the daughters of Flendel Halfgate. He used to live in this area and was 
considered one of the most loyal of our patrons. I believe the eldest was named 
Thea, but I am not certain. They might be of further assistance to you in this."<p>

<font color=#cc0000 size=+1>GRAIN FOUND:</font><p>

James motioned for help.<p>
Seeing that they were burdened with the heavy bag of grain, a burly priest named 
Vabon hurried to their assistance, taking the weight upon his own shoulders. 
"The high priestess will be most pleased to see you," the priest grinned. "Do 
you remember the way to her private garden?"<p>
Nodding, James turned through a small arch, holding up a woven curtain for Owyn and 
Gorath to pass through. Together they entered Risa's contemplation glade.<p>
Glancing up from where she was trailing a hand through the gentle waves of the 
pool, she smiled warmly at them. "You've brought the grain."<p>
"How did you know?" James asked, a little startled by the surety in the high 
priestess' green eyes.<p>
"There are certain advantages to living in the presence of a goddess," she 
laughed. "I knew this morning when I awoke that I would be seeing you. I also 
know that she will bestow upon one of you the boon of her blessing."<p>
"Blessing?" James asked, intrigued.<p>
Standing to assume a more priestess-like posture, she folded her hands in front 
of her stomach. "To the one you choose, she shall, for the rest of his life, 
watch over him to protect him from harm. This is Dala's Will."<p>
James gaped. "The goddess will make him invincible?"<p>
"Not as such, no," she said regretfully. But her favor will see to it that it is 
very difficult for him to be injured by those who seek to harm him. Who do you 
choose to receive this blessing?"<p>

<font color=#cc0000 size=+1>JAMES CHOSEN:</font><p>

The priestess nodded.<p>
Walking to James, she placed her hands on his head, her eyes flashing a deep green 
as she intoned the words of prayer to her goddess. As soon as she began to 
speak, the character of the room seemed to change, as if the walls were fat 
being rendered in a hot cauldron.<p>
"Dala," she cried out. "Protector Goddess, Shield of the Weak, Watcher at Hearth 
and Threshold, we seek your touch! This one who stands before your servant has 
acted with good faith in the name of thy faithful. As high priestess of your 
order, I ask that you bestow upon him your boon!"<p>
Shuddering, James gasped as a light flashed around him, seemingly emanating from 
within his flesh. The priestess seemed likewise shocked, though she recovered 
from its effects far more quickly. Slowly the effects of the flash faded and the 
room began to resume its more normal appearance.<p>
Standing away from James, Risa rubbed at her eyes with the heels of her hands. "It 
is done," she said unceremoniously. "You may go now. Dala has blessed you, James. 
Remember this always."<p>

<font color=#cc0000 size=+1>NO ONE CHOSEN:</font><p>

They were unable to choose.<p>
For a quarter of an hour, they discussed the issue at length, each indicating 
someone else as more deserving of the blessing. Amused by the debacle, Risa 
intervened. "Very well," she said, interposing herself into the good natured 
argument. "As you seemed to have all come to the conclusion that one man alone 
is not fit for Dala's blessings, I shall bestow her blessings on you all. Please 
go now, modest men. The gods love you truly."<p>

<font color=#cc0000 size=+1>SUBSEQUENTLY:</font><p>

James requested to see the high priestess.<p>
"I am afraid that is impossible," the attendant priest said. "She is away at the 
behest of Dala and may not return for some time. If you return at a later time, 
I am sure she would be pleased to see you."<p>

Gorath seethed.<p>
Four times they had asked one of the temple's blood stained priests to send for 
the high priestess, and four times they had been left waiting in the alcoves of 
the temple's central courtyard. When at last it became apparent their repeated 
summons were not going to be answered, Gorath shook his head. "It would seem the Red 
Jawed Hunter has other hunts to pursue. I am weary of waiting. Let us leave."<p>
