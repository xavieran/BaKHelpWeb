<h1>ABBOT'S JOURNAL</h1></center><hr><font size=+1>
<blockquote><blockquote>A translation of an ancient account of the travels of
an abbot from Malac's Cross, the book was filled with
stories and notes on mythology. Apparently the abbot had
been looking for proof of the existence of a sword known
as the Guarda Revanche, a cursed blade which was often
associated with the moredhel. Shortly before the end of
the journal, he related a curious tale:<p>
<i><b>".... and so came I unto the Abbey of Killian which stood
unto the western fringe of the forest of the Eledhel, so
named Elvandar, and there was shown a fairy chest upon
whose face were the runes which are common unto the
elven and moredhel kin. A certain father then did turn the
strange cylinders which were on the face of the chest,
forming a word unfamiliar with me, GLAMREDHEL, but one
which threw open the latches which bound closed the lid of
the box. From within he brought a finely jeweled hilt which
he called the Gaeda. This father then told me it had come
from a ruin of an ancient place and since, there was much
misfortune come unto their abbey and they willed it should
be returned there for its eternal rest. He also did tell me
other things strange and wondrous of the legend, saying a
spell had been bound into a shell that would repair the
blade which had long been broke away, describing this shell
as one marked with an uneven surface of ten misformed
lumps ...."</b></i>
