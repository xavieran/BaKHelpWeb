You may think I'm joking when I state that a <font color=#00ffff>Broken Elven
Crossbow</font> is the most precious item in the game, but I'm not!
It is - and here's why:<p>

<img src="cstring.gif" width=41 height=28 align=left>
Any Crossbow-buying Shop will buy a<font color=#00ffff> BROKEN Crossbow </font>
at <font color=#ff00ff>ONE ROYAL (0.01)</font>. 
You can then buy back as many as you want (at the same price), buy a
corresponding number of Bowstrings, restring the Bows, and sell the resulting 
<font color=#00ffff>100% Crossbows</font> at a HUGE profit! Of course the appropriate String needs to be 
available from the Shop (and often is), but this can easily be taken care of by first 
selling it to the Shop.<p>

<img src="cstring.gif" width=41 height=28 align=left>
A Light Crossbow is too cheap for this to work well, and the Medium one
won't appear in a Shop until Chapter 3. The Bessy Mauler doesn't appear
until very late in the game. Of the three others, the <font color=#00ffff>Elven Crossbow</font> is
the most expensive, and thus ideal for performing this trick.<p>

<img src="cstring.gif" width=41 height=28 align=left>
At the LaMut shop, for example, you will make a profit of approximately
<font color=#ff00ff>250 Gold Sovereigns</font> per each 
<font color=#00ffff>Elven Crossbow</font>. You only need to sell <font color=#ff00ff>40</font> of these in
order to make <font color=#ff00ff>10.000 Gold Sovereigns</font>!<p>

<img src="cstring.gif" width=41 height=28 align=left>
The best thing about this trick is that you can work it at the
very Start of the game, when money is at its scarcest. In fact
you can do it <font color=#00ff00>without leaving Zone 1</font> (the Yabon/LaMut/Zun/Hawk's
Hollow/Loriel/Tyr-Sog circuit). The key to this is the fact that
the LaMut shop has <font color=#00ffff>Elven Crossbows</font> for sale, as well as <font color=#00ffff>Light
Bowstrings</font>. The <font color=#00ffff>Crossbow</font> costs 
<font color=#ff00ff>797.5 Gold Sovereigns</font>, but with patience
Owyn can haggle it down to <font color=#ff00ff>638.0 Gold</font>. So what you need to do is,
first, afford the Bow, and then Break it. There's a small catch
here: In order to Break to Bow you will have to use it 40 - 50
times, so enough Combats are needed in order to achieve this.
This means that you must first collect the necessary money without
killing all the Enemies in the Zone.<p>

<img src="cstring.gif" width=41 height=28 align=left>
My preferred method of doing this is to utilize <font color=#00ff00>the road from
Tyr-Sog (via Yabon and LaMut) to Zun</font> for collecting the money.
I've managed to collect almost <font color=#ff00ff>800 Gold Sovereigns</font> in this area,
buying nothing except a Whetstone, an Armorer's Hammer, and a
Shovel. After the Bow has
been bought, I utilize the combats on <font color=#00ff00>the road from the Temple
of Killian (via Hawk's Hollow) to Loriel</font> to Break the Bow. This
procedure is described in more detail below.<p>

<img src="cstring.gif" width=41 height=28 align=left>
<font color=#ffff00>Please note:</font> All Weapons and Armor must be repaired before they
are sold. It is a good idea to repair them as soon as they're
found, just in case they are in better condition than the Weapons
and Armor held by the Characters. Always give the best to your
Characters!<p>

<img src="cstring.gif" width=41 height=28 align=left>
<font color=#ffff00>Also note:</font> Owyn doesn't need any of the Spells found in the area,
and he will soon be able to get them anyway. In Combat, let
Gorath and Locklear take care of close encounters, while Owyn judiciously
applies <font color=#00ff00>DESPAIR THY EYES</font> from a distance (resting in between, in order
to regain lost Stamina points).<p>

HOW TO BECOME RICH IN CHAPTER 1, ZONE 1:<p>
</font></center>

<font color=#ff0000 size=+1>Start a New Game.</font><p>

<ul><li><img src="cstring.gif" width=41 height=28 align=top><font color=#ff0000 size=+1>STEP 1:</font>


<ul>
<li><font color=#00ff00>Pick up Items from Haseth's Body and a nearby Chest, and the SPIDER Chest 
to the North.</font>
<li><font color=#00ffff>Pick up Armor from House in Yabon. Make sure Owyn has Armor.</font>
<li><font color=#00ff00>Sell extra Armor and Shell at Yabon Shop. Buy Hammer and Whetstone.</font> 
<li><font color=#00ffff>Repair ALL Swords and Armor.</font><p>
</ul>

<li><img src="cstring.gif" width=41 height=28 align=top><font color=#ff0000 size=+1>STEP 2:</font>

<ul>
<li><font color=#00ff00>Go North, towards Tyr-Sog, and clean out all Caches.
They are: Dirt (N of first Combat), Dead Body (near Trap),
SHADOW Chest, CANDLE Chest, Chest in Graveyard, House in
Tyr-Sog.</font>
<li><font color=#00ffff>There are only 3 Combats here, easily taken care of.</font>
<li><font color=#00ff00>Pick up every single Item (except bad Rations).</font> 
<li><font color=#00ffff>Do NOT read the Scrolls (!) - because you're going to sell them soon. (Owyn can get 
along fine with DESPAIR THY EYES and INVITATION.)</font>
<li><font color=#00ff00>In Tyr-Sog buy a Shovel, in order to get the Weedwalkers from Pul 
Dudding's Grave.</font><p>
</ul>

<li><img src="cstring.gif" width=41 height=28 align=top><font color=#ff0000 size=+1>STEP 3:</font>

<ul>
<li><font color=#00ffff>Now head towards LaMut, and stop at Yabon (where you can sell the 
Moredhel Lampreys).</font>
<li><font color=#00ff00>Don't miss the Caches between Yabon and LaMut: A Locked Chest, the DIE Chest, 
and a Dirt.</font>
<li><font color=#00ffff>Dig up three graves in the LaMut Graveyard: Rosel Lamutian, Klamontala Pechta 
and Goldie Crowe.</font> 
<li><font color=#00ff00>Enter LaMut, and don't miss the Bridge Cache.</font> 
<li><font color=#00ffff>Sell everything at the Shop, including the Scrolls (and don't forget to make sure 
the Weapons and Armor are in full repair).</font><p>
</ul>

<li><img src="cstring.gif" width=41 height=28 align=top><font color=#ff0000 size=+1>STEP 4:</font>

<ul>
<li><font color=#00ff00>Go South, towards Zun.</font>
<li><font color=#00ffff>There are three Combats here as well, all easy.</font>
<li><font color=#00ff00>The Caches are: Locked Chest near the Mac entrance, Dirt South
of this, a House in Zun, a Chest and a Dirt in the valley East of
Zun.</font>
<li><font color=#00ffff>Now return to LaMut with your spoils.</font><p>
</ul>

<li><img src="cstring.gif" width=41 height=28 align=top><font color=#ff0000 size=+1>STEP 5:</font>

<ul>
<li><font color=#00ff00>After selling everything in the LaMut Shop, you should now have
approximately 790 Gold Sovereigns (I've managed 791.0).</font>
<li><font color=#00ffff>Now buy the Elven Crossbow. Owyn can haggle this down to 638 Gold. It may
take some time (and patience), but I strongly recommend that you
do this, because you need a bit of extra cash to buy Quarrels
(the cheapest ones).</font>
<li><font color=#00ff00>Quarrels [50] should suffice, but buy 75, if you can, just to be on the safe side.</font>
<li><font color=#00ffff>It might also be a good idea to buy some extra Rations at the Tavern.</font>
<li><font color=#00ff00>Give the Crossbow to Locky, his Crossbow skill is lower than Gorath's.</font><p>
</ul>

<li><img src="cstring.gif" width=41 height=28 align=top><font color=#ff0000 size=+1>STEP 6: BREAK THE BOW!</font>

<ul>
<li><font color=#00ffff>I don't have the exact statistics here, but it seems that an
Elven Crossbow breaks at 35%. I've managed to do this by using
43 Quarrels. To begin with the Bow's condition seems to go down
by 1% - 2% with each Quarrel fired, but at a certain point (70%?)
it starts going down by a definite 2% with each Quarrel fired.</font>

<li><font color=#00ff00>There are now 12 Combats left in Zone 1, so this shouldn't be a
problem. I've managed this in 6 Combats. The trick is to change
your Combat Tactics, so as to allow Locky to fire the Crossbow
as often as possible (which basically means that you try to
postpone the end of the Combat as long as you can!). Some Enemies
will stubbornly go after Locky, and make it difficult for him
to get into an Archer's position. Owyn's DESPAIR THY EYES Spell
will come in handy here. Try to place Locky as far away as possible
from his target. This will make him miss more often.</font><p>

<li><font color=#00ffff>In case you're interested, here are the results from my first attempt:<p>

<table border=0 cellpadding=5>

<tr><td><font color=#00ffff><b>
Combat 04 (West of Killian)</b></font>
</td><td><font color=#00ffff><b>9 Quarrels fired</b></font></td>
<td><font color=#00ffff><b>Condition: <font color=#ff00ff><b>88</b></font></b></font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font color=#00ffff><b>
Combat 05 (West of Hawk's Hollow)</b></font>
</td><td><font color=#00ffff><b>8 Quarrels fired</b></font></td>
<td><font color=#00ffff><b>Condition: <font color=#ff00ff><b>79</b></font></b></font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font color=#00ffff><b>
Combat 06 (Near Charnel House)</b></font>
</td><td><font color=#00ffff><b>7 Quarrels fired</b></font></td>
<td><font color=#00ffff><b>Condition: <font color=#ff00ff><b>72</b></font></b></font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font color=#00ffff><b>

</td><td><font color=#00ffff><b>7 Quarrels fired</b></font></td>
<td><font color=#00ffff><b>Condition: <font color=#ff00ff><b>58</b></font></b></font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font color=#00ffff><b>
Combat 17 (NW of Ambush House)</b></font>
</td><td><font color=#00ffff><b>9 Quarrels fired</b></font></td>
<td><font color=#00ffff><b>Condition: <font color=#ff00ff><b>40</b></font></b></font></td></tr>

<tr><td><font color=#00ffff><b>
Combat 15 (Spellcaster in Trap)</b></font>
</td><td><font color=#00ffff><b>3 Quarrels fired</b></font></td>
<td><font color=#00ffff><b>Condition: <font color=#ff00ff><b>BROKEN</b></font></b></font></td></tr>

</table><p>

I could probably do better on my second attempt!</font><p>
</ul>

<li><img src="cstring.gif" width=41 height=28 align=top><font color=#ff0000 size=+1>STEP 7:</font>

<ul>
<li><font color=#00ff00>Now go back to LaMut with your treasured 
<font color=#00ffff>BROKEN ELVEN CROSSBOW. </font>
Sell it. Then buy it back. Now you only need a few coins in order 
to buy the first String, and then you're in business! It won't take 
you long to be able to afford those Greatswords available at the Yabon 
Shop, and Elven Armor for all your Characters. You can also buy back 
those Scrolls you sold earlier. And before you leave, why not keep one 
of those Broken Crossbows, and a Light Bowstring, just to make sure you can
repeat the exercise in a future Shop?!</font><p>
</ul>

</ul>

<img src="tsligbow.gif" width=88 height=54 align=left>
NOTE: There is, of course another possible way of achieving this (not
tested by me). The LaMut Shop also has a Tsurani Light Crossbow for sale (at 330.0,
haggleable down to 264.0). The cash needed to buy this can be collected faster,
and once broken, you only need to sell a few in order to afford the Elven one.
The problem is that now you need to break TWO Bows instead of one! There are
probably enough Combats in Zone 1 to do this, especially since the Tsurani Bow's
condition drops faster than the Elven one's. If you prefer this method, by all
means go for it. The above is just my personal preference.<p><p>
