<h2>THIFUL'S BIRD MIGRATIONS</h2></center><hr>
<blockquote><blockquote><font size=+1>
Many times [Gorath] flipped back the cover of the book to reaffirm that the
title had in <i><b>some</b></i> way been connected to the migration of birds. While
the author had <i><b>begun</b></i> a discussion on winged wildlife, he had quickly
meandered into a discussion of the famed battles of Midkemia, continued on to
a reiteration of various battle songs, diverted to a rant about the prices of ale
in the Kingdom's taverns, tangentially lamented about the plight of magicians and
then ended on a humorous anecdote about his mother-in-law having consumed a
vial of Fadamor's Formula to outslug a Tsurani warrior in a bar brawl.
