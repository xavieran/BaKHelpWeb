<h2>ACCOUNTS OF THE SHAMATA GARRISON</h1></center><hr>
<blockquote><blockquote><font size=+1>
Primarily the book was about <i><b>battle,</b></i> the majority of the text
concerning itself with the various famous skirmishes which had been fought
between the members of the Kingdom garrison at Shamata and the famed dog
soldiers of the Great Empire of Kesh. Perhaps more valuable was the wealth
of information which had been gathered on different fighting techniques,
each highly detailed with illuminated diagrams on stances, swings and other
issues concerning themselves with the art of fighting. Also included in the
book were a number of smaller anecdotes about standard life at the garrison, the
amount of food consumed in one month by the soldiers, the cost of weapons
imported from the empire and the difficulties in purchasing goods when 
political swings were taking place. One story which particularly took Gorath's
interest was a mention that a potion called Redweed Brew was a major import
of the garrison and that they claimed it temporarily enhanced how well the
soldiers fought in battle.<p></blockquote></blockquote></font>
