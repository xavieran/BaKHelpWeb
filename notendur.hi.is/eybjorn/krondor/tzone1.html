"Good enough," Gorath said. Turning on his heels, he marched to the door and 
knocked lightly as Owyn watched the street.<p>

shop that had recently gone out of business.<p>

man stopped next to Owyn and held up a palm stained with black ink. "A scribe 
tends to make quite a mess. Occupational hazard."<p>

of a small hill. Find out what's in that box and I'll give you the book. Now

trapped," he said.<p>
"Oh! Well, better that you discovered it than me," he said. He walked to

you about?"<p>
Locklear rubbed a loose floorboard with the tip of his boot. "We don't know."<p>

Locklear glared at the bald headed man who returned their gaze with contempt. "We 
should take it out of your hide, but provided you hold up to your end of the 
bargain, I suppose we'll let you be, as we have more important matters to 
attend to."<p>
"What? More important than threatening scribes?" Jeremy snapped, picking up a 
book and thrusting it into Locklear's hands. "I'll not have you accusing me of being a 
shyster on top of any other crimes you care to manufacture about me. Get out of 
here."<p>
Without a word they left, slamming the door behind them.

pieces of armor that had been suspended from the shops rafters.<p>
"You there, careful! It may all come down on our heads!" A gnomish man approached from the 
rear of the shop, a match held tight between his fingers. "Should have knocked. Nearly didn't 
hear you from upstairs - I can see why you came in though. Your armor is in quite a state. 
Another blow to your suit and you'll look like those lot up there. I'll fix you right up."<p>
"If it's all the same, I'd prefer to buy an armorers hammer..."<p>
"I'm sure you would, but I'm not in the business of ruining my livelihood. I'm an armorer and I 
make my living in repairs. People go fixing their own and I'm out of business. Right?"<p>

Everywhere Locklear looked, polished metal gleamed. As much a temple to 
war as any Temple of Tith, the cramped shop contained a startling variety of armor.<p>

Locklear surveyed their equipment.
"Which of your items would you like repaired, today?" the mender asked.<p>

leave it for a few days -- but for now PLEASE GO AWAY!"<p>

Faintly amused, Locklear complied and did as asked, extending both his hands for the stranger's

scrolls or anyone bearing scrolls. Read them carefully. They could save your life. Be safe."<p>

"Come in. My name's Lucan," he introduced himself as he slapped his guests on their backs.

here and the kids don't come down too often. You have kids? They're a marvel don't you think

Locklear seized Lucan's wrist and gave it a savage twist, forcing a shiny sovereign to fall 
from the man's pained fingers. Everyone watched in shocked silence as the gold clattered to the 
floor.<p>

Owyn where your practice locks are and he'll fetch them. Then we'll start our lessons..."<p>
Having resigned himself to the fact that he wasn't going to escape, Lucan lectured and
demonstrated for the better part of the day before he set his practice locks aside.<p>
