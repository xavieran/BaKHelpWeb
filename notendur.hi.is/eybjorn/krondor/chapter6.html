THE CHAPTER BEGINS<p>
</font>
</center>

<blockquote>

Pug concentrated on the storm.<p>

Whitecaps curled on the face of the Bitter Sea as furious jags of 
lightning slashed down from a darkening sky. Far off, the wobbling 
sails of ships leapt in the troughs of grey waves, struggling 
desperately against winds that threatened to shear them into ragged 
scraps. Fishermen and frenzied ship masters busied themselves along 
Krondor's docks as they raced to batten down flapping hatches and 
prevent unsecured goods from pitching into the churning seas. 
Everywhere there were planks and hammers and ropes, but among the 
workers not a soul dared utter a word.<p>

Wrongness. Pug sensed it as clearly as he smelled the salt in the air, 
and felt the hardwood railing under his hand. What had begun three days 
ago as a seemingly weak summer squall was intensifying into a threshing 
eye of violence. Within hours it would make landfall, doubtless 
bruising the livelihoods of many coastal towns, Krondor among them.<p>

Perhaps it can be tamed, Pug thought, his face twisting into a frown. 
More of a Lesser Path affair but it should be simple enough...<p>

Even as he extended his hand the image of another storm formed in his 
mind unbidden, a terrifying storm that had raged over his head as he 
came into the greatness of his power in a far distant Empire called 
Tsuranuanni, a storm that had tested his right to be a member of the 
alien Assembly of Magicians, a storm that had rent open the heavens and 
forever set him apart from other mortal men.<p>

Energy leapt from Pug's outstretched fingers into the heart of the 
storm, exploding within it a glorious rainbow pattern that illuminated 
the clouds in a throbbing elemental display. Greenish bands of color 
danced the sky as the wind began to abate, the torrential rains quickly 
softening to a mild patter as blue blasts of energy moved between sea 
and sky. Gently the ocean stilled of its own accord.<p>

Satisfied the threat was reduced, Pug discontinued the spell with a 
slicing gesture and stepped back to watch the storm's progress. The 
sight eased his mind and allowed him time to mull over a series of 
issues, not the least of which was the ruined vacation that he, his 
wife Katala and daughter Gamina, had intended on making in Krondor, but 
like a lodestone to metal he found his thoughts returning again and 
again to recollections of the Empire...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
Arrayed in flame the enemy comes, To shriek his cadence on skeleton 
drums...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAKALA:</font>
For thunder's spite we'll raise our call, Though down shall crumble 
Empire all.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAKALA:</font> 
A Tsurani poet. I believe he was House Omechan...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font> 
House Minwanabi, reign of the fifty third Light of Heaven...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
Is there something you need to see me about Makala? I am...busy.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAKALA:</font>
Busy? You have been behaving like a needra bull with a burr in his bit! 
I came to ask what has Pug of Stardock so distracted that he cannot 
find time to meet with his associate magicians? Has his reputation so 
inflated that a member of the Tsurani Assembly is no longer worthy of 
his attention?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
I am sorry. Perhaps you are right, I've just been very preoccupied.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
I find myself obsessed with this storm. All week I've felt it building 
over the Bitter Sea and all the while I have suspected there is more to 
it than is immediately perceptible. It doesn't feel natural. Have you 
seen its like?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAKALA:</font>
I have seen its match in destruction. As I recall, you created far more 
havoc in Tsuranuanni when you disrupted my Emperor's Imperial Games. 
Several city blocks destroyed, countless lives lost, the War lord cast 
down in dishonor...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
I had a feeling you didn't summon a rift-door to chastise me about my 
lack of attention. What is this about, Makala?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAKALA:</font>
Your loyalties, Pug. While you claim loyalty to the Empire, you live 
your life under the influence of a Midkemian King and took to wife a 
Thuril highlander. Your judgement is suspect!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
From the day I left the Empire, my judgement and my loyalties ceased to 
be the concern of the Assembly of Magicians. I do what I see is best 
for all concerned.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAKALA:</font>
I see. Then, is any act justifiable to that end?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
If it serves the common good, yes.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAKALA:</font>
Even if it violates an individual's rights?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
What do you wish for me to say, Makala?! You lead me as if I were one 
of your needra cows but I am in no mood for games. State your business.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAKALA:</font>
Very well. Your daughter Gamina has blossomed into a remarkable young 
woman. She is beautiful, gracious and an honor to your house. 
Unfortunately, she is also a girl with remarkable powers.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAKALA:</font>
Your love for your daughter has led you into a grievous miscarriage of 
your duties! Why have you let her live?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
My estimation of a person's magical talents is not determined by their 
sex, Makala, and I refuse to murder my child to appease a barbaric 
tenant of the Assembly! They have no authority in Midkemia!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAKALA:</font>
In this instance, I believe they will choose to ignore the geography. 
At this juncture, the Assembly is troubled - surrounded by anti-traditionalists
who embrace your Midkemian values, led in large part by Mara of the Acoma.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAKALA:</font> 
Open defiance by you as our most notable member could weaken our 
position within the Empire and that is something we cannot afford! We 
would be forced to make you publicly comply.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAKALA:</font>
Although I am equally wary of female abomination, I have no desire to 
see your daughter dead. I have acted on your behalf and placed her in 
exile until such a time we can agree upon her ultimate fate...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font> 
Why didn’t you consult me? Where have you sent her?!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAKALA:</font>
Seek her if you wish, but it will avail you little. Your further 
interference will likely ensure that the Assembly will carry out its 
order of death. They will be unable to kill her, however, if they 
cannot find her. It would be to your advantage to leave her be.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
I will not content myself to sit here while the Assembly banters about 
the value of my daughter's life! I shall find her and then you tell 
your brethren to expect my visit!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAKALA:</font>
You embark on a dangerous road but it is yours to take. Farewell then, 
Pug...<p>

TALKING TO KATALA</font><p>
</center>

<blockquote>

<font color=#ffcc00>KATALA:</font>
...the meditation tower being one of the first places I suspected of looking. 
I went there as soon as I discovered that neither he nor my daughter appeared for breakfast 
that morning. There I found the message that he had burnt into the wall.<p>


<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
The Book of Macros... What do you think the message means?<p>


<font color=#ffcc00>KATALA:</font>
I thought for a while that he intended for us to contact the magician named Macros, but it
would be a feat impossible for even Pug to accomplish. Macros left Midkemia long ago and all 
he left behind were his writings...<p>


<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
And presumably this Book of Macros would be among the books he left behind...<p>


<font color=#ffcc00>KATALA:</font>
Perhaps, but I cannot be certain. The library that Macros left on Sorcerer's Isle was vast and 
it took us the better part of a year to move the bulk of it to the Academy at Stardock. Since 
that time, some of the volumes have been lent out to various scribes so that they can be 
cataloged and transcribed.<p>


<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Then the book could be anywhere---a new approach. Before he disappeared, did you note anything 
unusual that he may have said or done?<p>


<font color=#ffcc00>KATALA:</font>
As I said earlier he had seemed agitated for some long time, but yes, there was something. About
a month ago we were walking in the gardens outside of the palace, just the two of us enjoying 
the day when he suddenly halted us near a sewer grate. When I asked him what was wrong, he said,
"Not all of the sheep are in our fold."<p>


<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Sheep? Forgive me, Lady, but your husband seems to have an infuriating penchant for the
cryptic...<p>


<font color=#ffcc00>KATALA:</font>
Not ordinarily, no, only when things are on his mind. But come, I must head towards Stardock and
look for evidence of this Book of Macros there. Where shall you two go?<p>


<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
We go below into the sewers under Krondor, Owyn, good Lady. I believe we shepherds have an 
errant flock of sheep to find.<p>

HEADING NORTH FROM THE TEMPLE OF LIMS-KRAGMA</font><p>
</center>

<blockquote>

Gorath stopped.<br>
With a face bearing signs of frustration, he turned to Owyn.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Our path seems futile. We need to find the Book of Macros. Perhaps a scribe 
might be our best source of information. What do you know of scribes in southern 
Midkemia?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
The Vaults of Sarth are, of course, replete with scribes. Brother Marc could 
help us there. Also, I've heard Abbot Graves at Malac's Cross is well known for 
such knowledge.

HEADING NORTH FROM SLOOP</font><p>
</center>

<blockquote>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Since we've come this far north, Gorath, I want to go on up to Cavall Keep.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Prince Arutha seemed to think that finding this Pug was of importance.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
It is important, but at the same time, we aren't far from there and I need to 
find out if Ugyne and my uncle are all right.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Why would they not be?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
We were captured by moredhel who had penetrated into the Kingdom as far south as 
Cavall Keep. Since they took us, how can I be certain they didn't ride into 
Cavall Keep and burn it all to the ground? May be Navon du Sandau's Nighthawk 
friends didn't appreciate their little ring being broken up and decided to take 
it out on the local count. I've been thinking about it since we escaped from 
Sar-Sargoth and it's something I just need to know.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
I don't wish to sound indifferent to the fate of your kin, but I think there are 
rather more important issues to concentrate on. If the Kingdom falls to Delekhan 
and his supporters, I can guarantee your relatives will find their deaths early. 
I will go wherever you lead, Owyn, but I think you should think with your head 
rather than your heart.<p>

ENTERING THE GREEN HEART</font><p>
</center>

<blockquote>

Gorath halted. Blinking slowly, he put a hand over his stomach, then looked 
towards his confused looking companion.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Hold for a moment, Owyn. I wish to speak to you.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Why? What is it?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
I merely wished to prepare you for things that may transpire before we reach 
Elvandar. There are magics -- things ancient -- which have kept the moredhel 
from crossing into the forests of the eledhel, but I feel those things have been 
awakened. I may have some difficulty in completing our journey.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Difficulty. What do you mean?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
It was not my intent to alarm you. Only to reassure you that no matter what may 
happen between here and Elvandar, I have come to consider you a friend.

ANCIENT VALHERU RUINS (if Abbot's Journal)</font><p>
</center>

<blockquote>

Thoughts filled his mind.<p>
Slowing in recollection, Gorath focused on his surroundings. The caverns 
themselves appeared unremarkable, yet this was a ruin of things ancient. What 
had been written in the Abbot's Journal? A chest... shell... Might it be?

THE CHAPTER ENDS</font><br>
<font size=+1>Entering Elvandar</font><p>
</center>

<blockquote>

Gorath faltered.<p>
A hand clasped to his gullet, he grimaced as Owyn looked to him for 
reassurance, forcing as much of a smile as he could for the boy's benefit. 
Imitating a gesture of fondness he had often seen, he reached out and tossled 
the squire's golden hair.<p>
"We have come to the moment," Gorath said. "Elvandar lies just ahead. 
Perhaps the Eledhel may put this matter of Macros to rest."<p>
Owyn nodded, peering into the heights hoping to catch a glimpse of the 
fair folk on their elaborate balconies among the leaves. "I am almost afraid to 
go on," Owyn said. "What if what we are looking for isn't here? What if the 
elves think were invaders and try to kill us?"<p>
"We will not be...harmed," Gorath said, gasping as the magic of the elven 
forest attempted to turn him aside. "If you think it is time to enter the city, 
then I follow. It is your decision, Owyn."<p>

</blockquote><center>
<img src="divsmall.gif" width=375 height=9>
</center><blockquote>

They emerged among trees.<p>
Seeing that the lights of the elven city were not far off, they cut 
through a field of long weeds, emerging at last at the base of a fantastically 
large tree.<p>

</blockquote><center>
<img src="divsmall.gif" width=375 height=9>
</center><blockquote>

Owyn gaped.<p>

Awash in light Elvandar glistened, its circuitous faerie walkways 
decked in glowing lanterns of brushed gold and crystal. Above, a canopy 
of silver white leaves arched over the whole of the tree-top city, 
masking from view whether sun or moon reigned in the skies beyond.<p>

"Gorath, isn't this the most perfect place you've ever seen ?" Owyn 
exclaimed. "I've never dreamt of anything like this!"<p>

"Squire, if you can hold your tongue for a moment," Gorath said, "it 
might behoove you to bow to their Queen."<p>

Flushed with embarrassment Owyn turned heel, shriveling as he noticed 
the cloaked figures who waited patiently upon their thrones. Quickly he 
folded in obeisance, hoping sincerely that human manners would be 
appropriate in the elven court.<p>

"We have come from Krondor with news about Pug of Stardock," Owyn said. 
"We were in hopes."<p>

"Silence, child." Queen Aglaranna spoke gently, her pale blue eyes 
glowing in the shadows. "Though we would hear of our dear friend, Pug, 
we first must attend to the unraveling of eons." Inclining her head 
towards Gorath, her voice and composure took on a grave edge. "You have 
come before us as a moredhel, but never may you leave Elvandar as such. 
Are you willing to return to us, your ancient kin, cousin?"<p>

Rage flashed in his eyes. Trembling with emotion Gorath advanced on the 
Queen, his hand darting to the hilt of his sword.<p>

"No, Gorath!" Owyn gasped, knowing his voice was too small to stay his 
friend's wrath. "You can't!"<p>

"I was Gorath of the Clan Ardanien," he spat, his voice thick with an 
ageless contempt. Color drained from his face as he gripped ever more 
tightly the sword at his side. "I am Gorath and I formally return to 
the Eledehel and swear fealty to Aglaranna, Queen of Elves and to 
Tomas, Prince Consort and Warleader." Falling to one knee, he knelt low 
before Aglaranna's feet. "I am yours to command, lady."<p>

His heart hammering an unsteady tattoo in his chest, Owyn stared in 
frank appraisal of the elves before him. Except for a glazed expression 
lingering on Prince Consort Tomas' face, he saw no evidence that any of 
them had witnessed anything unusual.<p>

"Rise. From this day forward, you are no longer moredhel, Gorath," 
Aglaranna said. "You are a member of the family of Elvandar and of the 
Eledhel. When your quest is done, you will return here to be one with 
us. That is our desire."<p>

"What is this news of...Pug?" As if wakening from a dream, the elven 
Warleader spoke the magician's name with great concern, his dark 
eyebrows rising in interest as Owyn began to elaborate the details. At 
times he would request that certain details be repeated, but always his 
glassy eyes became sharply focused when Owyn spoke the names of Pug and 
members of Arutha's court.<p>

"By the moons that means trouble," Tomas coughed as the boy finished 
his tale. "The Book of Macros is not a book but instead a gift that Pug 
gave to me long ago. I was to use it to come to him if ever he left 
that message for me. I must go."<p>

"You cannot, love. Even now I can sense the effects of the painkilling 
herbs beginning to wear off," Aglaranna said, laying a pale hand on 
Tomas' shoulder. As if broaching a delicate subject, she continued 
quietly. "Three days ago the Warleader was struck with a poisoned 
blade. Only last evening did his fever abate but he demanded to be 
brought here when he heard that a moredhel was returning. He hasn't the 
strength for the trip. You must go in his stead."<p>

"Don't try my patience, Aglaranna. Pug needs my help and I shall go!" 
Struggling to gain his feet, he blanched with the effort, standing 
straight only by groping the back of his throne.<p>

"How many of our kin carried you here, my Warlord?" the Queen asked, 
her voice laced with concern. "Was it five or six? You are no longer 
possessed by the soul of Ashen-Shugar and you are not gifted with 
immortality! None doubt your strength or loyalty, Tomas, but you owe it 
to Pug to send able help."<p>

"As always my love, you are wise," Tomas whispered, his strength 
beginning to fail him. Reaching beneath the seat of his throne, he 
brought forth a leather tome covered with dust.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
We may not be the strongest or the fastest, Tomas, but we are able and 
we are here. Send us to him.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>TOMAS:</font>
I have little choice. You, Gorath, shall be my emissary in this. May 
the blessings of Elvandar go with you...and tell Pug I am sorry.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
We shall.<p>
