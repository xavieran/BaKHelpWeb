<font size=+2 color=#00ffff>
RELIABILITY</font><br><font color=green>
In order to make sure that the MAP WEB is reliable, the Webmaster
has analyzed and consulted the game's data files (GDFs hereafter). The
"virgin" data can be found in the startup.gam file, or in any SAVE
file created at the very start of the game. The data from these files
has been loaded into a database, which has thereafter been used to generate
and double-check the data. The Webmaster has also subjected his databases
to some rigorous checks, resulting in dozens of (unimportant) corrections,
and is, at this moment (June 1, 1998), confident that the MAP WEB contains
NO IMPORTANT ERRORS. It might, conceivably, contain a few irrelevant errors,
and the Webmaster would be grateful indeed to whoever spots them!
<p></font>

<font size=+2 color=#00ffff>
VERSIONS</font><br><font color=#ffff00>
In the MAP WEB, two versions of the game have been
considered, Version 1.01 (the original diskette version) and Version 1.02 
(the CD-ROM version). The free download is basically identical to Version
1.02, but contains at least one serious bug. (A patch is available from the
Sierra website.)<p><font color=#ff0000>
The Webmaster has tried to point out all Version differences in the MAP WEB,
but he is very much aware that he may have overlooked some of them. Keeping
track of these is an arduous and complex task.<p></font></font>

<font size=+2 color=#00ffff>
ZONES</font><br><font color=#ff00ff>
The Midkemian Game World is divided into Zones. There are 9 Surface 
Zones (1-9) and 3 Underground Zones (A-C). It should be noted that this
division derives from the GDFs - it is not the Webmaster's invention. The
Zones and their divisions should be apparent to anyone studying the MAP
WEB's pilot page.<p></font>

<font size=+2 color=#00ffff>
MAP WEB STRUCTURE</font><br><font color=#00ff00>
Clicking a Zone will open a Zone Map. Most Zone Maps are composed
of many Sectors. Clicking a Sector will open a Sector Page showing
a detailed Sector Map.<p>
<font color=#999999>
All Sector Maps are Image Maps. You can click <font color=#ff0000>Red Arrows</font> in order to
go to a new Zone. You can click <font color=#00ff00>Green Caches</font> in order to view their
contents. You can click <font color=#ffff00>Yellow Combat Numbers</font> in order to view a Combat
Page showing a screenshot of the Combat, and the
Enemies' Statistics and Inventories. In some sectors there are
additional <font color=#ff00ff>differently</font> <font color=#00ffff>coloured</font> hot-spots to click, but they should
be intuitively obvious. (If not, you can just scroll down the page in
order to make sure you haven't missed anything.)<p>
</font><font color=green>
NOTE ON HOUSES: A House coloured <font color=#00ff00>Green</font> indicates that it is a Cache, or that
it is important for some other reason. It might mean that the inhabitants
will give you something, or that they can help raise your Skills. All other
houses are <font color=#999999>Grey</font>. This does not necessarily mean that you shouldn't
visit them - many of them are of interest in the unfolding of the story, others
add some comic relief, etc. Shops and Inns are coloured <font color=#ff0000>Red</font>, and are not
clickable - at least not for the time being. For information on Shops, please
consult the Shop Pages (from the LOOK Menu).<br></font>
<font color=#666666>I have plans to link the MAP WEB
to the SHOP WEB, but this won't happen just yet. I also plan to create INN Pages,
but I have no idea when I will find the time.<p></font>
<font color=#ff0000>
To give you an idea of the size of the MAP WEB, there are 73 Sector Pages,
and 435 Combat Pages, listing details of 1600 Enemies.<p></font></font>

<font size=+2 color=#00ffff>
SECTOR PAGE STRUCTURE</font><br><font color=#ffff00>
Each Sector Page is divided into four parts. The Sector Image Map is shown
at the top of the page. The Cache lists follow, and below them you will
find notes on various other things: NPCs, Traps, Sub-quests, etc. Finally,
at the bottom of the page a concise Combat or Enemy Table will be found. This
sets out, in abbreviated format, all the Enemy statistics and inventories. For
a less concise format, click the Combat Number in the table (or in the Sector
Image Map).<p></font>

<font size=+2 color=#00ffff>
NUMBERING OF COMBATS and ENEMIES</font><br><font color="ff00ff">
For each Zone the Combats and Enemies have been number-coded
for easier reference. Each Combat and Enemy Number is only
valid within one specific Zone. The numbers are seemingly
arbitrary, but they are actually based on data from the GDFs.<p>

The full Combat Code (seen at the top of each separate Combat
Page) contains four elements: The Zone Number, the Combat Number,
the Enemy Numbers, and the Chapter Code. Examples:<p>

<font color=#00ffff>1.03.004-005/1-3</font> Zone 1 - Combat 3 - Enemies 4 and 5 - Chapters 1-3<br>
<font color=#00ffff>2.03.006-008/1-3</font> Zone 2 - Combat 3 - Enemies 6, 7 and 8 - Chapters 1-3.<p>
</font><font color=green>
For your interest, there are 1600 Enemies (in 435 Combats) in the game.</font><p>

<font size=+2 color=#00ffff>
ENDLESS COMBATS</font><br>
There is a certain type of Combat, which can only be termed "endless".
A good example is the Army of Rogues surrounding the Prelate's House near the
Temple of Kahooli. You can fight them and kill them, but you won't be
able to search their bodies. They will immediately return, and unless you
want to go on fighting them, you will have to back out.<p>

In the Combat Grid the placement of a "resurrected" Enemy will always
be the coordinate where he fell when you last killed him.<p>

The interesting thing about these Combats is they are good opportunities
for raising you Combat Skills. The Enemies involved will progressively
weaken. They will keep their original Health, but their Stamina will be
ZERO after you've killed them once. The condition of their Weapons and
Armor at the end of one Combat will carry over to the next, so if you are
patient enough to fight repeatedly, you will soon be fighting extremely
weak Enemies.<p>

There are various, and devious, tricks possible in this situation.<font color=#00ffff><br>
Example 1:</font> If an Enemy has grown too weak to do you any Damage, don't
kill him. Just allow him to whack at you forever, and your Defense Skill will
rise.<br><font color=#00ffff>Example 2:</font> When all but one Enemy have been killed, freeze the remaining
one (not necessary if he's a wimp). Rest during the rest of your Turns, thus
regaining all lost Health/Stamina Points. Then kill the bugger.<p>
<font color=#ff0000>
There are two "endless" Combats which differ - the two groups of Tax Collectors
West and East of Lyton. These Enemies will not return immediately, but they will - 34
hours later - and they won't weaken at all.<p></font>

<font size=+2 color=#00ffff>
CHAPTER CODE</font><br><font color=#ffff00>

Combats are also Chapter-related. Some Combats are only
there in one Chapter. Others will be available in more
than one Chapters. A Combat fought, and finished, will of
course never be available again - but many Combats can be
avoided in one Chapter, and faced again in a later one.<p>

This is clearly indicated in the Combat Code. The last part
of this shows the Chapter Code (see examples above). The first
number indicates the first Chapter where a Combat may be encountered,
the second number the last Chapter. Thus:<p>
 
<font color=#00ffff>1-1</font> means "Chapter 1 only".<br>
<font color=#00ffff>1-3</font> means "Available in Chapters 1, 2 or 3.<p></font>

<font size=+2 color=#00ffff>
PLACEMENT OF COMBATS</font><br><font color=green>
I've tried to place the Combat Numbers as exactly as I can,
but please be aware that this is practically impossible in many
cases. The final placement will depend upon the direction from which 
the Combat is approached (and other factors), so don't be irritated 
if my placements are slightly off! (They will be close enough, though, 
for all practical purposes.)<p>

This problem is especially apparent in the regions around Sar-Sargoth,
where I've sometimes felt it necessary to show two placements for the 
same Combat.<p></font>

<font size=+2 color=#00ffff>
ENEMY STATISTICS AND INVENTORIES</font><br>
Presenting this data in an economic manner in the concise Combat/Enemy
Tables (in the Sector Pages) was extremely difficult. There is a lot of data to be shown
for each enemy, and somehow this had to be presented so as to fit
the width of a computer screen. (For this reason it is not recommended
that you change the default font of your browser when viewing these - if you
increase the font size, most of the tables run off the screen.)<p>

This data may look incomprehensible to you in the concise Combat Tables,
but as soon as you get the hang of them, I think you'll agree that they
are quite successful in presenting a lot of data in a narrow space.<p>

The structure of these tables is best explained by using an example.
Here's an example Combat:<p>

<font color=#00ff00>MF</font> - This is the Enemy Code. MF stands
for Moredhel Fighter. The Enemy Codes will be treated separately
below.<p>

0209 - This refers to the COMBAT GRID. The Combat Grid will be treated
in detail below. This number means that the Enemy's coordinates in
the Combat Grid are 2,9.<p>

06 - This is the RETREAT Factor. All I know is that an Enemy
Retreat Factor of 00 means that the Enemy will NEVER RETREAT.
As the number gets higher, he will be more likely to flee.<p>

the Enemy.<p>

54 - This is the Crossbow Skill. Why does this Enemy have such a skill? He
doesn't even hold a Crossbow! More on this later. The Crossbow Skill would be
color-coded as <font color=#ffff00>YELLOW</font>, if the Enemy were holding
a Crossbow and Quarrels. In such a case he would be a Moredhel Archer, and the
Enemy Code would be <font color=#00ff00>MA</font>.<p>

00 - This is the Spellcasting Skill. This will always be color-coded <font color=#ffff00>YELLOW</font>, if the Enemy is a Spellcaster.<p>

<font color=#00ffff>SKA51 BSW76 RSS04</font> - This is the Enemy's Inventory. We've seen
that the Enemy Codes are two-letter abbreviations. Item Codes are three-letter 
abbreviations (shown in full below).
In this specific case:<p>

<font color=#00ffff>SKA51</font> - Standard Kingdom Armor 51%<br>
<font color=#00ffff>BSW76</font> - Broadsword 76%<br>

This Enemy (a <font color=#00ff00>R</font>ogue <font color=#00ff00>M</font>age) 
is practically DEAD. All his skills are Zero. He won't be able to use his Sword,
and all his Spells are useless.<p>
You will notice that he's holding a Broadsword and Standard Kingdom Armor. You
should easily be able to guess what <font color=#00ffff>RUB40</font> means. Note
the yellow four-letter abbreviations at the end. These are Spells, and it should
be pretty transparent which Spells they are:<p>

<font color=#ffff00>FLAM</font>ECAST, <font color=#ffff00>GRIE</font>F OF 1000
NIGHTS, <font color=#ffff00>SKIN</font> OF THE DRAGON, and

<font size=+2 color=#00ffff>
COMBAT PAGES</font><br><font color=#0000ff>
As earlier noted, the concise Combat Tables are there for quick reference. For
more detail you can click the Combat Number, and open the relevant Combat Page.
This will show a screenshot of the Combat, and the Enemy Statistics and Inventories
in an easier-to-read format.<p>

The few abbreviations used here should be obvious: <font size=+1 color=#00ff00>HEA</font>lth,
<font size=+1 color=#00ff00>STA</font>mina, <font size=+1 color=#00ff00>SPE</font>ed,
<font size=+1 color=#00ff00>STR</font>ength, <font size=+1 color=#00ff00>MEL</font>ee,
<font size=+1 color=#00ff00>DEF</font>ense, <font size=+1 color=#00ff00>CRO</font>ssbow
and <font size=+1 color=#00ff00>CAS</font>ting speak for themselves.
<font size=+1 color=#ff0000>DAM</font>age is Health+Stamina, i.e. the Damage needed to kill.
<font size=+1 color=#ff0000>RTR</font> is the Retreat Factor. Skills shown in <font color=#999999>Grey</font> 
are non-existent or irrelevant.<p>
<font color=green>
Deciding how to order the Enemy Data (especially when there are more than three
of them) has often been very difficult. There are two basic rules I've tried to
stick to:<p>

1. The Data Tables should imitate the positions of the Enemies as closely
as possible.<p>
2. If the Enemies need to be presented in two or more rows, the most dangerous
ones are placed in the top row. For this reason Spellcasters and Archers
will often be found in the top row, while Fighters will be placed below.<p></font>
</font>
<font size=+2 color=#00ffff>
FIGHTERS vs. ARCHERS</font><br>

Here I've needed to differentiate. Moredhel Warriors, Rogues,
Quegian Pirates, Goblins, Nighthawks and Black Slayers can be either 
Fighters or Archers. The two-letter codes used to differentiate are:<p>

<font color=#00ff00>MF</font> - Moredhel Fighter<br>
<font color=#00ff00>MA</font> - Moredhel Archer<br>
<font color=#00ff00>QP</font> - Quegian (Pirate) Fighter<br>
<font color=#00ff00>QA</font> - Quegian (Pirate) Archer<br>
<font color=#00ff00>RG</font> - Rogue Fighter<br>
<font color=#00ff00>RA</font> - Rogue Archer<br>
<font color=#00ff00>GF</font> - Goblin Fighter<br>
<font color=#00ff00>GA</font> - Goblin Archer<br>
<font color=#00ff00>NH</font> - Nighthawk Fighter<br>
<font color=#00ff00>NA</font> - Nighthawk Archer<br>
<font color=#00ff00>BS</font> - Black (Slayer) Fighter<br>
<font color=#00ff00>BA</font> - Black (Slayer) Archer<p>
<font color=#ff0000>
A small problem: Lots of enemies have Crossbow Skill, even if they
don't have a Crossbow! Some enemies have a Crossbow, but suffer from
a ZERO Crossbow Skill (meaning they can't use the Crossbow)! To simplify
matters I have defined an Archer as an Enemy with a Crossbow in his
inventory. Perhaps I should have classified Crossbow-Holders with ZERO
Skill as Fighters, but let's not be too pedantic. These are very few.<p></font>
<font color=#ff00ff>
NOTE: Some Enemies' Crossbow Skills are used to determine a different
type of attack. A Troll's Crossbow Skill determines his ability to throw
Rocks at you. A Wyvern's Crossbow Skill determines a special type of
attack, which is a mystery to me.<p></font>

<font size=+2 color=#00ffff>
SPELLCASTERS vs. MAGICAL ATTACKERS</font><br><font color=#ffff00>
There's a line to be drawn here. Some Enemies seemingly cast Spells,
and have a Casting Skill, but don't have any Spells listed in their
inventories. Among these are Wind Elementals, Wyverns, Dreads and Shades
- and the "Spells" they cast are obviously not any of the Spells known
to us by name. These Enemies are the Magical Attackers. Their "Spells"
seem to be inherent to them, and each group has the same Spell(s). As an
example, all Wind Elementals have one "Spell". It looks like WINDS OF EORTIS,
but obviously isn't. Details on this are not obviously available from the GDFs.<p>

On the other hand we have Spellcasters, like Moredhel Spellcasters, Tsurani
Spellweavers, Pantathians, Rogue Mages and Highland Ogres. These Enemies'
Spells are clearly defined, listed in their Inventories, and known by name.<p></font>

<font size=+2 color=#00ffff>
COMBAT GRIDS</font><br>
These have already been mentioned. Although a somewhat complicated matter, the
basics are easy to understand:<p>

At the start of a combat you can see the Combat Grid by punching the
[G]-key on your keyboard.<p>

The Combat Grid is basically a coordinate system.
A regular Combat Grid (above ground) will measure 8 (x-axis)
by 13 (y-axis) squares. Here's a typical one:<p>

<img src="grid.gif" width=314 height=121 align=left hspace=10>
<font color=green>
On the x-axis the 8 squares will be indicated by the
numbers 0 - 7. On the y-axis they will be indicated by
the numbers 0 - C. Those of you who are familiar with
hexadecimals won't be puzzled by this, but for the less
enlightened it should be enough to state that 1-9 equals
1-9, A equals 10, B equals 11 and C equals 12.

Now take a look at the grid.<br clear=all><p></font>
<font color=#00ff00>
The extreme corners
are defined as:<br>

Near left: 0,0 (this can never be occupied)<br>
Near right: 7,0 (neither can this)<br>
Far left: 0,C<br>
Far right: 7,C<p>
<font color=#00ffff>
Now it should be obvious that the Moredhel Warrior is
occupying square 2,6, Locklear 1,1, Owyn 3,0, Gorath 6,2.<p></font>
</font>
(Underground there's less space to move around. All "Dungeon"
Combat Grids measure (8 by 7). Same restrictions apply (0,0 and 0,7
are unoccupiable).<p><font color=#ff0000>

Sounds simple, doesn't it? I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint
you.<p></font>

Combat Grids can easily get modified, if you approach
the combat from a vantage point which doesn't allow the
whole 8 by 13 (or 8 by 7) grid enough space. It can wildly diverge from
the above, if you happen to approach the Combat in a very
narrow space. For a not-so-wild example, see the below. This is exactly
the same combat as above, but we have appraoched from a
different direction, close to a mountain side:<p>

<img src="gridx.gif" width=314 height=121" align=left hspace=10>
<font color=green>
Note how some squares become inaccessible. These are:<p>

0,3<br>
0,2 1,2 2,2<br>
0,1 1,1 2,1 3,1<br>
0,0 1,0 2,0 3,0<br>
<br clear=all><p>

Any Character or Enemy occupying these squares in the Regular
Combat Grid will, of course, have to be moved. In this case
Locklear moves (to the right) along the x-axis to the FIRST POSSIBLE occupiable
square. This is a very simple case - there are some extremely
narrow places in the game where the REGULAR GRID becomes almost
unrecognizable!<p></font>

I don't want to delve into this matter in detail here, but there
are a few basic rules I've observed:<p>

<ul><li>If a Character's or an Enemy's
Combat Grid Placement is that of an unavailable Square, he will
MOVE TO THE RIGHT on the x-axis, to the first occupiable Square.

<li>If there is no available Square to the right on the x-axis,
he will move towards you, starting at the extreme left. Example: 
An Enemy is situated at 7,3 (at extreme right). Square 7,3 is not
available. He will move to 0,2, and if this is not available he will
try 1,2 - etc.

<li>So what happens if he can't go any further? I haven't researched
this in detail (it doesn't happen a lot), but from what I've seen, I'm
pretty certain that an Enemy/Character that exits the Combat Grid at
the NEAR RIGHT corner, will re-enter at the FAR LEFT corner! (This is
not easy to achieve - I've had it happen once or twice, with Characters,
and they were there, tiny, facing me at the far side of the Grid.)
</ul><p>

ABBREVIATIONS</font><br><font color=#ffff00>
In the Combat Data Tables I've (obviously) needed to employ
various abbreviations. If you're well familiar with BAK and the
BAK Help Web, these will mostly be obvious to you. But in case
you're not, I've included complete indexes.<p>

There are THREE types of abbreviations - two-letter for Enemies,
three-letter for Items, four-letter for Spells. Please
consult any/all of the below:<p>

<a href="abrenem.html">ENEMIES</a> (an alphabetical index of Enemy abbreviations)<br>
<a href="badguys.html">ENEMIES PLUS!</a> (a graphic table of Enemy data)<br>
<a href="abritema.html">ITEMS</a> (an alphabetical index of Item abbreviations<br>
<a href="abritemb.html">ITEM CLASSES</a> (a classified list of Item abbreviations)<br>
<a href="abrspll.html">SPELLS</a><p>
</font>
<font size=+2 color=#00ffff>
MODIFIED ITEMS & OTHER RELATED MATTERS</font><br><font color=#cccccc>
In the concise Combat Tables I've needed to color-code Modified Swords
and Armor. You may object to the colors used, but please remember
that some browsers allow only a limited palette. I'm trying to
please all.<p>

Let's use a 77% Sword of Kinnur to demonstrate this:<p>

<font color=#0000ff>KIN77 - Bless #1</font><br>
<font color=#ffff00>KIN77 - Bless #2</font><br>
<font color=#ff0000>KIN77 - Bless #3</font><p>

<font color=#ffffff>KIN77 - Frosted</font><br>
<font color=green>KIN77 - Poisoned</font><br>
<font color=#cc0099>KIN77 - Steelfired</font><br>
<font color=#ff00ff>KIN77 - Flamed</font><p>
<font color=#00ffff>KI</font><font color=#ffff00>N</font><font color=#00ffff>77</font><font color=#ffff00>- Clerical Enhancement #1</font><br>
<font color=#00ffff>KI</font><font color=#0000ff>N</font><font color=#00ffff>77</font><font color=#0000ff>- Clerical Enhancement #2</font><p>

From the above it should be easy to work out the possible combinations. Here are
a few examples:<p>

<font color=#0000ff>KI</font><font color=green>N</font><font color=#0000ff>77</font><font color=#0000ff>- Bless #1</font><font color=green> and Poisoned</font><br>
<font color=#ffff00>KI</font><font color=#0000ff>N</font><font color=#ffff00>77</font><font color=#ffff00>- Bless #2</font><font color=#0000ff> and Clerical Enhancement #2</font><br>
<font color=#ff0000>KI</font><font color=#cc0099>N</font><font color=#ff0000>77</font><font color=#ff0000>- Bless #3</font><font color=#cc0099> and Steelfired</font><p>

If you find this too confusing to contemplate, just click the Combat Number. This
will open the Combat Page, where the Enhancements are easily comprehensible.<p>

There's one more example of color-coding I've used in the Inventories. This
is quite rare, but you can see it, for example, in Nago's Inventory: <font color=#666666>NOT30.</font>

The <font color=#666666>Dark Grey</font> Color indicates that
this is a VERSION-DEPENDENT ITEM. The item in question is here
in version 1.02, but not at all in version 1.01. (This won't happen
often, I promise.)<p>

<font size=+2 color=#00ffff>
TEMPLES</font><p>

<font size=+2 color=#ff00ff>
<img src="glkill.gif" width=94 height=94 align=left>
<img src="blucros2.gif" width=36 height=40 align=left>
TEMPLE OF KILLIAN</font><br>
<font color=#00ffff>
Bless Type #1 - Price: 25 + 75% of Basic Price<br>
<img src="transp.gif" width=38 height=5>
Basic Curing Factor = 65<br>
<img src="transp.gif" width=38 height=5>
Teleport = YES
</font><br clear=all>
<p><font color=#00ff00>

Take a good look at the above example, which sets out the format of Temple
information in the MAP WEB. Since I still haven't set up any Temple Pages,
I think some explanations are needed here.<p>
<font color=#00ffff>
BLESS PRICE. </font>In the above case there's a <font color=#00ffff>BASIC FEE (25.0)</font>
and an additional percentage <font color=#00ffff>(75%)</font> of the Item's Basic Price.
<font color=green>(Basic Prices can be found in the Shop Pages.)</font><p>

Example: <font color=#00ffff>Basic Price</font> of Sword of Lims-Kragma is <font color=#00ffff>1000</font>.
Having this blessed here will cost <font color=#00ffff>25+(1000*0.75)=775</font>. The <font color=#00ffff>BASIC
FEE</font> and <font color=#00ffff>PERCENTAGE</font> will vary between Temples.<p>

<font color=#00ffff>BASIC CURING FACTOR.</font> This varies between Temples as well. Here it is <font color=#00ffff>65</font>.
The cost of a cure depends on this factor <font color=#00ffff>(BCF)</font>, and the Condition
Type Factor <font color=#00ffff>(CTF)</font>, and the severity of the Condition <font color=#00ffff>(CON)</font>.
The <font color=#00ffff>CTF</font> is as follows:<p>

<font color=#00ffff>3.0</font> if Near-Death<br>
<font color=#00ffff>1.0</font> if Plagued<br>
<font color=#00ffff>1.0</font> if Poisoned<br>
<font color=#00ffff>0.4</font> if Sick<br>
<font color=#00ffff>0.3</font> if Drunk<br>
<font color=#00ffff>0.2</font> if Starving<p>

<font color=#00ffff>CON</font> is expressed as <font color=#00ffff>0.xx</font> (<font color=#00ffff>40%</font> Condition equals <font color=#00ffff>0.40</font>).<p>

The formula for computing the cost is:<p>

(<font color=#00ffff>BCF</font>*<font color=#00ffff>CTF</font>*<font color=#00ffff>CON</font>)+(<font color=#00ffff>BCF</font>*0.01) <font color=green>- result will be truncated to the nearest Royal.</font><p>

Examples (using Temple of Killian):<p>

<font color=#ff0000>NEAR-DEATH</font> <font color=#ffff00>40%</font> = (<font color=#00ffff>65</font> * <font color=#00ffff>3</font> * <font color=#00ffff>0.40</font>) + (<font color=#00ffff>65</font> * <font color=#00ffff>0.01</font>) = <font color=#00ffff>78.65</font> = <font color=#ff00ff>78.6</font><br>
<font color=#ff0000>PLAGUED</font> <font color=#ffff00>47%</font> = (<font color=#00ffff>65</font> * <font color=#00ffff>1</font> * <font color=#00ffff>0.47</font>) + (<font color=#00ffff>65</font> * <font color=#00ffff>0.01</font>) = <font color=#ff00ff>31.2</font><br>
<font color=#ff0000>POISONED</font> <font color=#ffff00>54%</font> = (<font color=#00ffff>65</font> * <font color=#00ffff>1</font> * <font color=#00ffff>0.54</font>) + (<font color=#00ffff>65</font> * <font color=#00ffff>0.01</font>) = <font color=#00ffff>35.75</font> = <font color=#ff00ff>35.7</font><p>
