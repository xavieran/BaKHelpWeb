<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Your husband has at last returned.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CULLICH:</font>
Husband? How so? Clan leader? By what right? Upon a time you held all those titles with dignity 
and honor. Around you, the Clan Ardanien was curled like a golden dragon, ready to rise up at 
your word and crush whatever lay in your path. Where is that dragon now? Why does it sleep?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Cullich...is that all you dream of beneath your strange stars? A dead past? What value in all 
Murmandamus' speeches did we gain but to learn that we are weak? What spirit did we discover in 
defeat except that we corrupt from within? The time has come to blunt our blades and look to our
own, to put down the monsters that we have become.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CULLICH:</font>
What destiny would you have of the moredhel, Gorath? Should we bend our heads to the earth once 
more, enslave ourselves to the will of the Eledhel who live in Elvandar much as we trembled 
beneath the Valheru in black centuries past? Their Queen Aglaranna will not accept us back into 
the fold as family, but instead as slaves. You've seen our brethren that have returned to them. 
What are they but gelded bulls in elven servitude?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
I know not whether they rejoice or weep under their midnight stars, but their children grow to 
great ages, they trade freely under the Kingdom sun. We must fight for so little as a loaf of 
bread and kill our cousins lest they steal our kits from their dreaming. It is time we became 
more than savages.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CULLICH:</font>
Why have you come here, Gorath? Surely not to debate a love that between us is dead.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
No...I need your help but for a short time longer and then I will be away and leave you to your 
own. So much I ask from my former wife. You then may be free to do as you see fit.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CULLICH:</font>
In the name of one I loved once, I listen and I will do as I can. Speak, Gorath.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
We need of you a scrying. What road will lead us to safety?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CULLICH:</font>
I needn't consult the stars for your answer, for I have looked upon it for days since you left.
Delekhan masses on the Kingdom's borders, the banners of the Clans Krieda, Dargelas, and Oeirdu 
flutter on the fields near Raglam. I would seek no passage south through the Teeth that leads by
the Kingdom fortresses of Northwarden or Highcastle; doubtless Narab shall be at their head.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Narab has turned on the old wolf. Sar-Sargoth is encircled with his clan. He shall not trouble 
us.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CULLICH:</font>
Nonetheless, the armies are gathering and you will find none among them friends. Neither may you
pass across the Great Northern Mountains through Moraelin. Moraeulf works with The Six to ensure
that none of the former clans of the Green Heart may escape through the fringes of Elvandar.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Lims-Kragma feast on his soul! He believes if we cannot run, we will join his accursed march?!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CULLICH:</font>
Again, your only means of escape lies along the Inclindel. For whatever reason, the Six have 
allowed the snows to lift. Perhaps they are otherwise occupied focusing their magics.<p>

These Six who now serve Delekhan, from what clan do they arise? Perhaps their loyalties may be 
reversed.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CULLICH:</font>
They are mighty in their arts, husband, far beyond even my powers. They claim the ancient title 
of Spellweavers, though they are vastly different from those of our magical cousins in Elvandar.
Some suspect they hail of the serpent people, but long it has been since I touched the mind of 
those folk in the Northlands.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
I thank you for saving our lives. Without your assistance my companion and I would have 
perished under Delekhan's hand.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CULLICH:</font>
I would not wish your death, but I am not to thank for your recent escape. Why would you think 
me a part of it?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Magic was involved. While we were captive, someone released us from our bonds. I had assumed you
were responsible.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CULLICH:</font>
Someone else acts in your favor, Gorath. It was not I. I should question who it is and what 
their motives for doing so would be.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
If we are to slip undetected through the Inclindel, we may require your skills of illusion. One 
such as you summoned when I first escaped Delekhan's men.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CULLICH:</font>
You know not what you ask... That spell was great in its fashioning and left of my power nothing
for a month! I cannot follow where you go for I believe yours is a coward's path!<p>

Owyn fidgeted.<p>

Unable to pick meanings out of the harsh-sounding moredhel tongue, he nonetheless understood the
tone of the conversation between Gorath and the strange moredhel woman. Whatever they were 
saying, they weren't in agreement.<p>

"She will speak with you," Gorath snapped, his face flushed with rage as he stalked to the 
window. "Listen to what she says."<p>

"But how will I understand what she's saying?" Owyn said. "I don't know moredhel."<p>

"Weyoda aldeweynn," Cullich whispered. Gliding to his side, she gently took his hand and began 
to stroke it. "Weyoda aldeweynn, Owynna... You will understand."<p>

It seemed days had passed.<p>

"What happened?" Owyn shook his head and was shocked to find himself lying on the ground. Above 
him, Gorath and Cullich were watching with intense interest as he regained consciousness. "What 
kind of spell did you cast on me?"<p>

"What you have been taught is special," Cullich replied, helping Owyn to his feet. "You will now
understand all I speak to you and you will also find your skills as a spellcrafter are much 
greater than they were before. Walk around a bit. My husband and I have more to discuss."<p>

If we should encounter Moraeulf and The Six, I should like to be better prepared to meet him.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CULLICH:</font>
There is a spell I crafted once that I may teach the boy. It is an illusion which bends the 
perceptions of those nearby in such a way that they cannot see you for who you truly are. 
Instead, you are seen as a resident of the area which you wish to enter. It has been 
specifically tailored for the town of Harlech, perhaps of use to you when you deal with 
Moraeulf. If you have 800 silver I may teach it to Owyn, or an equal sum in gold that I might 
buy the silver I require.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
You would charge us for this?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>CULLICH:</font>
While I would be within my rights to do so, I require silver because it is needed for the 
fashioning of the spell. Do you have the coin?<p>

Time passed. His head swimming with the details of the spell, Owyn repeated the cantrip line by

head. "You have learned well," she said. "Go and rest for a few moments."<p>
