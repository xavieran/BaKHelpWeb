They knocked on the door and waited for a reply.<p>
There were some shuffling sounds, then the door swung open and they found themselves staring 
down at a dwarf. "Well, bless me bones. What brings you lads so far from home?"<p>
He invited them into his house, and offered them some fresh water for their pouches. He asked of
their journey and they told him, briefly.<p>
"You've heard about the troubles being had by the Elves, then?" he asked.<p>
"Trouble?" questioned Owyn.<p>
"Aye. Damnedest thing! Baby dragons have been attacking Elvandar. Warleader Tomas has been
doin' his best to keep 'em out, but there's only so much he can do."<p>
He talked some more of the attacks, and of the strange rock-like inhabitants that had been 
spotted in the Mac Mordain Cadal. They surprised him with a description of how they had killed 
one of the creatures.<p>
Thanking him for his kindness, they left.

Owyn was greeted at the door by a familiar face.<p>
"Welcome back, lad. What can I do for you?" inquired the dwarf from inside his house.<p>

doesn't have anything new to tell us."

Owyn knocked on the door. Hickory scented pipe smoke slid underneath, curled gently around his 
feet. The smell had barely reached his nose when the door was flung open and they were greeted 
by a smiling dwarf, "Great day! Come in, laddies. Join us."<p>
Over his left shoulder they could see several other dwarves seated around a small wooden table, 
onto which they were tossing small square stones.<p>
Introductions completed they were invited to join the game. "Only five sovereigns, what do you

Standing around the table, Owyn was given a stone and after a count of three all were thrown

"Klapka," yelled one of the dwarves, grabbing the stone thrown by Owyn. "You lose, lad." He 
scooped all the coins into his lap.<p>

"Atta boys! Drop 'em in the pot and pick up your stones."<p>
Once again, they tossed their stones on the table at the count of three.<p>
This time, two of the dwarves stood up excitedly and yelled, "Vooka, vooka!" They picked up their 
stones and tossed them down again. After the second throw, one dwarf slammed his fist on the 
table and the other, grinning broadly, scooped all the coins into his lap.<p>
"Ack, vooka stones. Care to try your luck again, lads?"<p>

<font color=#cc0000 size=+1>
YES:</font><p>

"Very good. I think your luck is about to change," said the dwarf.<p>
They tossed the stones on the table for a third time, the strange markings on each side flipping
and spinning wildly as they bounced across the table.<p>
"Tabled!" said one of the dwarves cheerfully. "All coins stay on the table. Will you play again?"<p>

<font color=#cc0000 size=+1>
YES:</font><p>


Owyn tossed five more coins onto the table. Once again, at the count of three he threw his stone.
This time, the settling of the stones was greeted by amazed silence as all the dwarves stared 
at the table.<p>
"Ack!" yelled one dwarf. "It cannot be!" The others quickly joined in, and soon all were 
whispering and arguing amongst themselves in a language Owyn couldn't understand.<p>
Finally, while the others looked on in disgust, the dwarf who had met them at the door spoke,
"You threw a dragon, lad." Realizing the import wasn't sinking in he continued, "You threw a 
dragon and we all threw vookas!"<p>
"Did we win?" Owyn asked, still confused.<p>
"Kill me now. Aye! You won everything!" The other dwarves began to dump handfuls of coins on the
table. "Must be over a hundred gold pieces. You'll be playin' again, won't you?<p>
Before the dwarves had a chance to complain, Gorath picked up the coins and headed for the door.
"You've gotta give us a chance to win our money back," the dwarf yelled after them.<p>
They pretended not to hear.

No one had answered the first knock, so Owyn knocked again.<p>
Finally, a hoarse voice called to them, heavy with a dwarven accent, "Who's callin' me?"<p>
"We come from the Kingdom. Can we come in?" Owyn asked.<p>
"Aye. The door's open, do as you like."<p>
They opened the door and entered a dimly lit room, sparsely furnished. In one corner they could 
make out a shape, apparently laying on a bedroll.<p>
"Come in. Come in. Rest your bones a minute," said the dwarf in a tired voice. With his eyes 
closed, as though he were seeing the event on the inside of each lid, he told them of his 
journey from Caldara, and of the wyverns he had seen circling Elvandar.<p>
"The bloody moredhel are roamin' about, too. Took a sword in the side from one." He rolled over 
and they could see the deep gash extending from his hip halfway up his hairy back.<p>
"Can we do anything for you?" Owyn winced at the gaping wound.<p>
"Nah, it looks worse than it is. I just need a few more days to rest up, that's all."<p>
They wished him well and left quietly.

Owyn flung open the door, eyes still glittering with the treasure he was sure he would find

as a small explosion knocked the pair backward, out of the tree, and to the ground nearly thirty 
feet below.

Owyn painfully climbed the rope leading to the house in the trees. Gorath followed him, climbing 
onto the main branch as Owyn peered inside, past the broken windows.<p>
"Careful, my friend. Remember what happened last time you opened that door."<p>
"I remember. I remember. Think it was rigged to go off more than once?"<p>
"Not likely," replied Gorath, heading for the door. "But after the explosion I doubt there's 
anything left inside." He opened the door slowly and then, with building confidence, slipped 
inside, Owyn at his heels.<p>
The explosion had scarred the walls of the building, no doubt destroying the trap and the fake 
chest that had been used as a lure. Owyn couldn't hide his disappointment as they climbed down 
the tree.

Blake Puget, a former scout for King Lyam in Rillanon.<p>

The elves are payin' me a pretty penny to help keep the dark bastards out." He eyed Gorath

Owyn nodded his head. He retrieved the heart and made his way, apprehensively, to the Rusalki.
Hands trembling slightly he placed the object in front of the creature, then quickly stepped
away.<p>

"You have done what was asked, and now shall you be rewarded," it said, producing a dozen
packages of rations. "Also, there is something which was left on the shores of this river
ages ago which will be of assistance to you on the road ahead. Please take it in thanks from
all of my kin."<p>

By two roads may you reach the Queen of the Eledhel. If you wander the main roads there are
many hazards, but your enemies shall face you. Wander the path less travelled and you may find
you face a less substantial opponent. In this, Prince Calin may be of some assistance.

He scooped up some more water and drank it, almost greedily. Then some more...<p>
"I think this well must contain healing water," said Gorath. "Because it is making me

Owyn eyed him suspiciously, noticed the way Gorath's eyes were swimming around inside his head.
"You're...drunk. What's in that well, straight ale?"<p>

Before he could knock, an angry female voice yelled, "I have a sword, moredhel, and I'm not 
afraid to use it! Get out of here!"<p>
Owyn called back, "We mean you no harm. We have a very important message for Warleader Tomas. 
Can you help us find him?"<p>

The door opened slowly exposing a dark skinned elf with wrinkled skin. He looked at them with 
only mild concern, and after a moment allowed them into his house.<p>
"My name is Falan," he said, introducing himself. Then he turned to Gorath and said, "I have
seen many returnings in my years, but none such as yours."<p>
Gorath nodded slowly, but didn't speak.<p>
Falan told them of the Wyverns attacking Elvandar from the north, and of the elves who were
desperately trying to defend their borders from a moredhel invasion.<p>
As they left, Falan pointed them toward Warleader Tomas. "He is due north of here. Good luck."

The coarse white rope swung back and forth in the gentle breeze.<p>
"Ready?" Gorath asked Owyn, who obviously was NOT looking forward to the work it was going to
require to climb to the top of the tree.<p>
"Yeah, sure. Let's go. Follow me."<p>
Painfully, he pulled himself to the top of the tree and, still panting, turned to watch Gorath's
almost effortless ascent.<p>
The small elven house midway up the tree was abandoned. Searching inside they discovered several
empty boxes, each intricately carved; a hammock style bed; and a pile of dead leaves that had 
obviously blown in through the missing back window.<p>
They were about to leave when Gorath spotted something in the trees above them. He climbed up 
to take a closer look as Owyn carefully scooted out further on the branch he was on.
Pulling back a handful of scorched leaves revealed the badly burned body of a young male elf.<p>
"I'd say this one fought a losing battle with a Wyvern," Gorath said grimly.<p>
They descended the tree in silence.

Approaching the tent Owyn had heard at least two strange voices coming from inside. Now, Gorath 
had drawn his dagger and was poised, catlike, next to the entrance. He motioned for Owyn to 
stand back.<p>
With the skills of an accomplished assassin he threw back the flap of the tent and rushed
inside. Owyn followed, ready to help. But by the time he entered one of the two moredhel 
soldiers was laying on the floor, clutching weakly at his throat as blood spurted onto the dirt 
floor.<p>
The other soldier, though caught by surprise, had managed to grab his own dagger and stood with 
it drawn, facing Gorath. He faked a couple of jabs, then lunged forward slicing into Gorath's 
arm -- the same arm that grabbed his coat near the elbow, pulling him forward, and into Gorath's
thrusting dagger.<p>
He fell to the ground and Gorath finished the job with a slice across the front of his throat.

The shuffling sounds that had been coming from inside abruptly stopped. Owyn knocked again, 
holding onto a low hanging branch for support.<p>
"Please go away," called a young elf from inside the house.<p>
Owyn stepped closer to the door. "We aren't going to hurt you. We're friends of Tomas, and we 
need to find him."<p>
The door opened slowly and a young elf emerged. In the room behind him, Owyn could see a box and
several vials sitting on a small wooden table.<p>
The young elf, though obviously intimidated by Gorath's presence, told Owyn of the moredhel and 
wyvern attacks on Elvandar. He went on to talk of the elven army and his mission to bring them 
several vials of water from a nearby well, a well purported to have a magical water that could 
permanently increase strength.<p>
He seemed anxious to leave so they wished him luck as he packed up the remaining vials into the 
box. With barely a sound, and the box under one arm, he slipped to the ground and disappeared 
into the trees.

"Nothing seems to be happening," he said. "Perhaps this was another moredhel trick."<p>
"Perhaps. But not all the magic in this world must be accompanied by twinkling lights and
swirling fire." Gorath dipped a cup into the well and raised it to his lips. Glancing at Owyn, 
whose eyes appeared to be twice their normal size, he tipped back his head and let the cool 
liquid rush into his mouth and slide down his throat.<p>
A wave of heat rushed through his body, then a wave of cold. He closed his eyes as tiny
