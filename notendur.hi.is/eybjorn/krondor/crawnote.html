<h2>CRAWLER'S NOTE</h2></center><hr>
<blockquote><font size=+1><b>
I am uninterested in your difficulties with the Guild of Thieves under
Krondor. It was your responsibility to deal with them and your special 
training should give you more than an adequate advantage over those common
thieves. You are to locate the Amulet of the Upright Man and the Idol of
Lassur and load them aboard the Night Crawler immediately! We have pressing
business with our serpentine clients in the Sunset Isles and I <b>don't</b>
believe they will be patient while I tell them about the incompetence of my
hirelings!<p>
The Crawler<p>
