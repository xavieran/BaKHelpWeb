A pleasure to see you again, James.<p>

Mine is the greater pleasure, my lady. Is Pug about?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KATALA:</font>
You've just missed him. He and Makala went off to discuss magic someplace and if I know my 
husband, that means I won't see him for a few days. Even on holiday, he can't seem to take his 
mind away from the art for long.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
In many ways, he and the Prince are much alike. Where is Arutha anyway?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KATALA:</font>
Out with his twins and the Princess Anita. It seems your famed luck is running thin today.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Quite the contrary, for I still have your company. If I may have a moment?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KATALA:</font>
As much time as you need. What may I do for you?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
We need to get a bit to eat. What does Kadzu have on the burn, or should I ask?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KATALA:</font>
Actually, the palace kitchens aren't open at the moment. Prince Arutha has been taking his meals
privately and the rest of his staff have been told they can get makings from the kitchen if they
need, but for the time being Kadzu has nothing to do. I could probably get a few packs of 
rations for you, assuming he has some made up.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
It's not necessary, really. With you and Pug vacationing here in Krondor, it should be the other
way round.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KATALA:</font>
No, I insist. I'll only be a moment.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
She amazes me. I understand from Pug that she treats all the students at Stardock like they 
were her personal wards. You'd think with two children and the most powerful magician anywhere 
to tend to, she would have her hands full...<p>

Owyn looked down at his shoes.<p>

Glancing back up at James he remarked, "She seems like a nice lady." The seigneur was about to 
respond when they heard the faint sound of Katala's approaching footsteps. Cupping the back of 
his hand to his mouth, James whispered, "She is."<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Back again, Katala? That was quick.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KATALA:</font>
There were some already prepared, so I snatched them up for you. I made sure they were
fresh first, of course.<p>

So, when do I get to meet this stunning daughter of yours? I've heard quite a bit about Gamina, 
but I've been too busy to make the time to meet her.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KATALA:</font>
I imagine you will see her as soon as I do. She's more than likely trailing Pug and Makala about
the palace. Any opportunity to hear her father discuss magic and she's immediately at his side. 
Then too, it may be she's hiding away from Arutha's twins. She's not quite interested in boys 
yet.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I know that quite few of the artificers in Stardock have begun exporting their goods from the
Academy. Are there any good places to buy magical items near here?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KATALA:</font>
The most notable one that's close is a little place called Stardock Annex at the Abbey of Ishap 
at Sarth. Officially they have no ties with the Academy, but there's not much we can do to keep 
them from using the name. There's also a fellow by the name of Dabeh who buys from us, but he 
lives a long distance from here, out north of Romney if I recall.<p>

Do you think you could deliver a message to Prince Arutha for me?<p>

I can certainly try. What is it?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Just tell him that we haven't reached the Black Sheep Tavern in Romney as yet, but I will send 
word to him as soon as I can.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KATALA:</font>
I don't think that will be too much of a problem. I will see he gets it as soon as he returns.<p>

James!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Seigneur James at your disposal, Lady. I'm sorry if I have interrupted you.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KATALA:</font>
No, no. Actually I am quite pleased to have you here, James. Things around the palace have 
become very peculiar. Prince Arutha hasn't held court in weeks and Pug has been locking himself 
up with Makala and our daughter Gamina discussing who knows what.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
And you feel left out of the circle, is that it?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KATALA:</font>
I suppose I have been privileged---spoiled even---in the past because he has entrusted me with 
whatever he was thinking. He's shown me things that I could never have imagined and yet now he's
hiding something from me. At some level, I'm almost inclined to think that something is 
frightening him.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Frightening Pug? Gods, I don't like the sound of that! May I speak to him?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KATALA:</font>
I wish you could, but he has gone to our Academy at Stardock. I don't know when he plans to 
return. To make matters worse, when I went to see Prince Arutha he sent word that he couldn't 
speak to me because he was busy with matters of state. That's not at all like him.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
No, it isn't, but I have a few suspicions about what this may all mean. First, there are a few 
things I need to know...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KATALA:</font>
I am at your service.<p>

Begun what?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Sorry, I was thinking aloud. If you would, do you think you could tell him something for me? 
It's fairly important that he hear it.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KATALA:</font>
What is the message?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Tell him that the party in Romney was cancelled because our host took ill and now we're looking 
for his pet parakeet that flew away. As soon as we find the perch, we will meet him for tea at 
mother's.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KATALA:</font>
I'm not sure I understand...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
But the Prince will. I don't mean to be mysterious, but it's better that only we two know what 
is going on at the moment.<p>

Has anything happened in Krondor since I left, or has the whole town closed up of boredom
waiting for me to return?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>KATALA:</font>
Nothing unusual, really. The most exciting thing I've heard is that there appears to be an 
outbreak of Quegian fever in some of the ports, but they don't expect things will get too 
serious. The priests from the Temple of Sung have sent men down to the docks to deal with
any cases that show up there and the palace guards have been advised to keep a lookout for 
anyone who seems to be suffering from delusions. They think it will be contained in the areas 
north of Krondor.<p>
