The animal was dead.<br>
Caught in a hunter's trap, it didn't appear to have been lying on the ground 
too long...<p>

The animal was dead.<br>
Gorath peeled the creature's corpse, being careful of the trap's iron teeth 
while trying to find enough meat to wrap up into a packet of rations.

Several pieces of charred wood and a circle of small stones were all that 
remained of the small campfire.<p>

The ashes were cold.<br>
Wiping the grime off his hands, Gorath shook his head. "Someone or something 
obviously set up camp here, but it's hard to say just when."

It was a bag.<br>
Stitched together from a light canvas material, it looked as though it could 
contain a large number of things.<p>

James carefully opened the light canvas rucksack. Praying that its contents 
hadn't already been discovered by a greedy traveller, he peered inside...

Locklear frowned.<br>
"It's a body, he said. "We might want to look it over."<p>

James checked the corpse.<br>
"No sense being squeamish," he said, rifling through a rucksack which lay next 
to the body. "Supplies are supplies wherever you find them. This fellow won't be 
needing them anymore."

Owyn looked for supplies.<br>
Feeling a bit like a vulture, he turned the body this way and that as he 
searched for anything that might be of use to them on their journey. All in all, 
he supposed that if he were the dead man, it wouldn't matter to him any longer 
what happened to his belongings.

</td><td valign=top>
<b>

Thinking only made it worse.<br>
Setting aside his reservations about pilfering the fallen, he decided he would 
take what the goddess of luck had given them. However immoral he might feel 
about it, he was certain his stomach would quickly assuage his guilt if he found 
a bit of food to eat.

The leaves were dull.
Shaded in dull browns and ochres, the bush wasn't much to look at, but it might 
yield berries that could be eaten.<p>

James pawed through the thick limbs of the bush.
Sampling a small dark berry he nodded then called to the others, "They're 
edible. Help me see if there are enough here to bundle into a small pack... "

The leaves were dull.
Shaded in dull browns and ochres, the bush wasn't much to look at, but it might 
yield berries that could be useful.<p>

Owyn pawed through the thick limbs of the bush.
The small colored berries made his fingers warm and he instantly recognized 
their restorative potential. He called the others over," Help me see if there 
are enough berries here to fill one of my spare vials..."

The leaves were colorful.
Shaded in bright reds and oranges, the bush was breathtakingly beautiful.<p>

bit funny but help me see if there are enough here to bundle into a small

James stared at the corn.
Far too young for consumption, it still looked quite good.<p>

The corn was too young.
Discarding the ear he had picked, James shrugged his shoulders. "Eating this 
would just make us sick. Let's move on."

The crystals were odd. 
Unlike anything Owyn had ever seen on Midkemia, the formations seemed to pulse 
with an internal energy...<p>

Owyn's fingers tingled. 
Grasping the strange looking crystals, he pulled as hard as he could.

MOUND OF DIRT</b></font>

<blockquote>

The small mound of dirt seemed to indicate that someone had recently dug a hole 
here. It was not clear, however, whether anything valuable was actually buried 
in it.<p>

Something had been buried under the dirt.<br>
"The hole's not big enough to put a man in, so it's safe to assume it isn't a 
grave," James said. "Might be a secret cache of food or supplies. Let's take a 
look."

<blockquote>

James was suspicious.<br>
Although it appeared innocuous enough, the pile of stones could signify any 
number of things; traps, treasure, graves, chests... anything.<p>

The search was futile.<br>
Exasperated, James restacked the rocks into a pile, partially relieved that at 
least there hadn't been a trap of some sort waiting for them under the stones.

It was coming apart.<br>
Judging from the hay which spilled from the figure's shirt, the scarecrow had 
been assembled in a hurry by a desperate farmer.<p>

James grunted.<br>
Despite his repeated efforts to pull the scarecrow out of the ground, it 
wouldn't budge.

Once it had been a tree.<br>
Rotted and moldy, only a hollow shell of bark remained of the oaken bole.<p>

James approached the wooden stump cautiously. Seeing that it was hollow he 
looked inside...

James studied the well.<br>
He had hoped, perhaps, the well would have a sign attached to it with some 
notation of whether its water was good or bad, but no such information seemed to 
be in evidence anywhere he looked.<p>

Drawing some water from the small well, they drank greedily.<br>
Then, stopping only long enough to fill their pouches, they packed up and prepared to leave.
