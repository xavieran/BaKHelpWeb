<h2>LETTER FROM DELEKHAN</h2></center><hr>
<blockquote><font size=+1><b>
We know now Gorath of the Ardanien to be on a path to the capital of Krondor. We advise
you to continue your duties, but suggest you lie in wait for him on the eastern roads into
Krondor, as it is likely they will take an indirect route there so as to avoid your
patrol. He must move no further south. Halt him before he reaches the Kingdom settlement of
Tanneurs.<p>
