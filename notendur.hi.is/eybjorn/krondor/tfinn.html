A horn sounded in the Inclindel.<p>

Immediately several additional notes echoed the first, passed on down the bend of the canyon
while shadows began to appear along the length of the defile. Rising up from behind rocks and
out of ditches, a dozen scattered men responded to the call to arms. Appearing at the mouth of
a previously unnoticed cave, a fortyish looking gentleman lumbered down from his hiding and
seeing that his guards weren't needed, he whistled for their dismissal.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>FINN:</font>
Well, I didn't expect you to be back this way so soon, Seigneur. I actually wondered if you were
going to make it anyplace at all, cut up like you were.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Where's your company, Lieutenant Finn? Why aren't they standing standard guard on this pass?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>FINN:</font>
With all due respect, Seigneur, we're digging ourselves out of a pretty mess presently. Not long
after you and the moredhel trounced through here, a white screamer came up out of nowhere, worst
snow storm I've seen in sixteen years. Ten miles on down the dell, the pass is buried under five
feet of snow. I sent out guards to help our forward positions but I'm not positive they can do 
much. Kind of like lighting your pipe under the Bitter Sea.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
There's no way to get through the Inclindel at all?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>FINN:</font>
Not unless you're a snow burrowing mole or a firedrake, no sir. Whoever may be in the Northlands
or in the Kingdom, they've got a long wait on their hands if they need to get down this road.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Well that's it then. We'll have to turn back. Take care, Lieutenant.<p>

</td><td valign=top>

Horns announced the lieutenant's appearance.<p>

Working his way down from his cavernous command post, Finn shook his head as he pulled his
furred helm down tight over his ears.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>FINN:</font>
You must believe in miracles, Seigneur, but I'm afraid the weather isn't nearly so cooperative
as that. The Inclindel is still frozen solid. Half my men have frostbite so bad its going to
take three years to get the cold out of them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
No getting through then.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>FINN:</font>
No, sir. Sorry. You might try Cutter's Gap at Highcastle or perhaps Northwarden Pass.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Damn these northern winters. I doubt we'll find any open routes to the north, but thanks for 
the suggestion. Take care of yourself, Lieutenant.<p>

There's no getting through those snowdrifts out there. The Inclindel is blocked and it'll likely

<font color=#ffcc00>FINN:</font>
I don't know what you're doing here, Seigneur, but I don't think the Inclindel is a place any 
civilized folk want to be. Even the Hadati hillmen are bundling up and heading south towards 
Yabon and let me tell you something. It's a sure damn cold day when you get a Hadati thinking 
about a town for refuge.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
You must be Lieutenant Finn. Seigneur Locklear spoke highly of your garrison when he returned to
Krondor. We were very sorry to hear about your commander's death.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>FINN:</font>
It happens. We don't get too sentimental up here with our butts cheek out to the moredhel. Too 
easy to get your best friends killed so you don't get to be best friends. Of course, we depend 
on each other to protect one another but...not much beyond that. I don't think you came all this
way to tell me that you were sorry about our commander. What do you need, Seigneur?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
We were thinking of heading North...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>FINN:</font>
Not through there, you aren't. Even with the snow starting to melt off, the damn moredhel set 
off some kind of explosion. Brought down half a mountain of rock and it'll take us some time to 
get through it.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
You say set off. Were they using naphtha in there?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>FINN:</font>
Very probably. Must of had packs of the stuff planted in the rocks, set up to slap us if we came
down the pass. I think someone on their side got jittery when we were poking around. Whatever 
the case may be, no one's going either way for a little while.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Thanks for the information, Lieutenant.<p>

I hope you aren't planning on going through here, Seigneur, 'cuz the Inclindel's still plugged 
tighter than a jug.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I was afraid of that. Thanks, Lieutenant.<p>

Gorath's pulse quickened as he saw the lone figure approach; but when it became apparent they
were not being attacked, he relaxed a bit, squinted slightly in an attempt to see who was about
to join them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>FINN:</font>
What are you two doing back up here again? Prince Arutha sending you on another secret mission?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Of a sort... We're looking for a book that was lost...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>FINN:</font>
Well, just between us, don't you think this would be a damn peculiar place to find a book? It's 
not like any of us ever get the opportunity to sit still long enough to read a book, and as far 
as the moredhel go... I don't think that stealing books would be very high on their list of
priorities.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Is the Inclindel passable?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>FINN:</font>
Either you two are gluttons for punishment or just down right thick... No, the Inclindel isn't
open. A few weeks ago, they blasted it shut again. Personally, I think we should leave the damn 
thing closed, but our orders are our orders, so my men have started picking things up again. I 
don't know why King Lyam is so bent on keeping the passage open to Armengar, but then again, I 
don't suppose it's my place to wonder why.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Thanks for your information, Lieutenant Finn.<p>

The Inclindel is closed...hear me...CLOSED. That means you and your moredhel friend here are
going to have to find another way North if you're so all fired bent on going there.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
We should be on our way again. Thank you for your time, Finn.<p>
