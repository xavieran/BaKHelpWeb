The man who greeted them at the door smelled of fish.
"Folks call me Chanty," he said after Owyn introduced himself.<p>

After a few more minutes of friendly conversation he revealed he was a
fisherman, but he hadn't been out on his boat for several days due to his
health. As he spoke he threw dark looks at an unseen thing over Owyn's
shoulder.<p>

Owyn was about to ask him another question when Chanty suddenly mumbled
something angrily and slammed the door closed. No amount of coaxing could
convince him to open it again.

"Have you seen my gold?" asked the man at the door.<p>

"I'm afraid we haven't," said James. "Aren't you Chanty the fisherman?" he
questioned.<p>

"Yes, but I didn't mean to do it," he replied wildly. "I was looking for my
gold, I didn't know it was still...alive." He shivered involuntarily.<p>

James looked at Owyn, then continued, playing along though he wasn't sure
what the man was talking about. "But you did do it. Why don't you tell us
about it?"<p>

Shaking harder, Chanty said, "It was a black thing...I dug and dug...then
it grabbed my arm and I pulled away but it wouldn't let go and then it clawed
its way out...and it talked to me. The demon thing spoke to me
and...and...thanked me for letting it go." He stopped, nearly in tears. "It even gave
me a reward. It gave me passwords for a couple of the local fairy chests.
Said they were: EYES and RING." Unable to control his fear any longer, he retreated into 
his house, slamming the door.

A man answered Owyn's's knock.
His face was flushed and there were beads of sweat on his brow that threatened
to race each other down his face at any moment. He was breathing heavily.<p>

"You've come about them, haven't you?" he asked, wide eyed. "Well?"<p>

After several long minutes of careful probing, Owyn was able to ascertain that
the man believed he had released some evil spirits from a couple of the local
graveyards. The more he spoke of his dealings with the undead the more
frightened he became, until at last, shivering violently, he closed the door

Turning to Gorath, Locklear said, "Shall we dig up this grave?"<p>

After a brief discussion with Locklear, Gorath shook his head.<p>

The man didn't look happy.<p>

"He don't talk much," called a voice from the other side of the tavern. "He's
a pretty somber fellow. Folks call him Grimm 'cuz he never laughs or smiles."
Another voice said, "He's pretty much a fixture here at Babon's. In fact, we
often have a little fun with strangers. We'll give you 80 sovereigns if you
can get Grimm here to laugh. Care to give it a try?"<p>

<font color=#cc0000 size=+1>
YES:</font><p>

James nodded.
"Indeed we would like to give it a try," he said, then turning whispered,
"Let's see...how are we going to get this fellow to laugh?"<p>

<font color=#ff6600 size=+1>[SPOON]</font><p>
"I've got it," said Owyn. "This is a little trick I used to amuse my
father with."<p>

He squatted down in front of Grimm, tipped back his head and began to sing.
As the words to the silly song tumbled from his mouth he carefully balanced
a spoon across the bridge of his nose.<p>

Grimm frowned.<p>

<font color=#ff6600 size=+1>[BAWDY]</font><p>

"I'll try," said Gorath. He turned to Grimm and with a sly smile began a
bawdy tale detailing a romantic tryst between a dwarf and an elf maiden.
Glancing around the room with a mischievous smile Gorath reached the punch
line, "'It just in'a gonna work, said the dwarf, 'What with me down here and
you up there.'"<p>

The end of the story brought stifled snorts and snickers from around the
room, but Grimm simply nodded.<p>

<font color=#ff6600 size=+1>[SHIP]</font><p>

James stepped forward.<p>

"This little tale should knock him out of his chair. It was related to me by
a Tsurani soldier. Seems one of their sailing ships was caught in a fierce
storm that damaged the vessel so badly it began to take on water. There were
rafts on board and most of the men got off safely, but it quickly became
apparent to the captain that there were only three spots left and four of
them still on the ship.<p>

'I'm going to ask each of you a question,' he said. 'Answer correctly and
you can join your mates on the raft.' Turning to the first man he asked, 
'The Fire Storm sunk off what peninsula?'.'The Honshoni peninsula, sir.'
The captain nodded and pushed the sailor toward the raft. Then he turned to 
the second man. 'How many were aboard that night?' Deep in thought the
second sailor finally blurted, '154!' Again, the captain nodded, pushing the
sailor toward the raft. Finally, with one eye on the rising water, he turned
to third man. 'What were their names?' The joke over, Owyn looked at Grimm
expectantly as loud guffaws filled the room and men doubled over and slapped
their knees and lost ale through their noses.<p>

Grimm yawned.<p>

<font color=#ff6600 size=+1>[CANCEL]</font><p>

"The man's a rock," complained James. "I'm afraid we just can't do it."<p>

<font color=#ff6600 size=+1>[SUMANI]</font><p>

Owyn looked thoughtful.<p>

"Sumani told us a joke, does anyone remember it?" His question received
nothing but blank stares. "Let's see if I can remember this story," he said 
to Grimm. "During the reign of the Hidjacumo - "<p>

"Hidjucama," corrected Grimm.<p>

"Yes. Well, the lords of the minor houses of the
Omal...Omah...THREE MINOR LORDS, were summoned to the Holy City for an audience..."<p>

"...be praised ! The Emperor shall love his new shoes!" finished Owyn,
pleased he had remembered most of the tale. He turned to Grimm expectantly,
but found not a hint of expression on the man's face. Owyn sighed in disgust,
and was about to reach for his money pouch when he heard a snort, like a mad
bull. He looked at Grimm. Then he looked around the room. Nothing...<p>

"Well, I guess we - " Owyn began.<p>

"SNORT!" The corners of Grimm's mouth began to quiver. Then his face turned
red and his body began to shake uncontrollably. It was like watching a
volcano about to explode.<p>

"HA HA!" screamed Grimm. "Tha - tha - HA HA!" Tears began to clean crooked
paths down the sides of his dirt streaked face, as he rolled forward and
fell on the floor in spasms of uncontrollable laughter.<p>

There was a moment of stunned silence, then one of the men spoke, "I don't
believe it! Old Grimm's actually laughing!"<p>

The man behind the bar produced 80 gold sovereigns. They took the money and
left.<p>

<font color=#cc0000 size=+1>SUBSEQUENTLY:</font><p>

Owyn spotted Grimm.<p>

Glances were exchanged and Owyn began to call out to him but the man
suddenly tipped back his head and began to roar with laughter! When he had
at last calmed down a bit Owyn approached his table.<p>

"Good day to - " Owyn began, but this brought another peal of laughter, and
all soon realized that any further attempts at conversation would be futile.<p>

eating, but I had some luck fishing today so there's plenty to go around."<p>
Locklear's nostrils flared as he welcomed the smell of the barbecued sea bass and fresh bread
still lingering in the air. "Its a tempting offer, but I'm afraid we must be going," he said.
A drink of fresh water will suffice."<p>

The boy paused for a heartbeat. "My folks were killed a year back. Mitch and I moved here
several months ago to study swordplay with Tad Questor. We're gonna find the bloody brigands 
who did it and feed em their own hearts!"<p>
Locklear was about to offer some fatherly advice about leaving such work to those older and
more qualified, but seeing the boy's expression he decided against it. Instead he asked, "Is
Tad good with a sword?"<p>
"What, are you kidding? He's the GREATEST! Lives right over there." The boy motioned toward

"Lesson?" inquired Locklear.
The man disappeared into his house and returned with a blunt tipped fencing foil. "Have you

credentials. After all, this strutting little peacock looked as though he had never been in a
fight in his life.<p>
Their doubts were quickly dispelled as Tad took them through the finer points of sword use.
Though he may not have had much experience in the field it was evident to all he was a master
of his art. He was even able to offer Owyn a few pointers on how best to use his staff in

The small house, it turns out, was home to a slight, balding historian named Kellyn, who talked

fresh water for their packs.<p>

"The folks I've interviewed, the ones living near Sethanon, say they thought the world was 
coming to an end - like the fabric of heaven was being turned back upon itself, revealing 
another universe in the skies. And they all talked about the explosion and fearsome flying 
beasts circling in the sky." His voice trailed off. "I think it may have something to do with 
the Dragon Lords who once roamed freely on this world. One day I'm going to figure it all out."<p>

Locklear laughed. "I'm sure you will, Kellyn -- some day -- and when you do I'd like to read
