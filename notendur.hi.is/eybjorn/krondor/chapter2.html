THE CHAPTER BEGINS<p>
</font>
</center>

<blockquote>

A whisper led him through madness.<p>

He stumbled forward with unfamiliar feet ten times too small to belong 
to a warrior. There were lights on the hills around him, fires, voices 
shouting through a downpour of sloshing hoof beats. He reached for his 
sword then remembered that he hadn't a sword that night. He had only 
been a boy of twelve Midsummers. Only a boy and yet he led the ragged 
remains of his father's tribe.<p> 

<i>Who leads the moredhel?</i> the whispering voice insisted in his head. <i>I 
must see more.</i><p>

Years. A river of men coursed together in a bleeding tide and he was 
amidst them. Screams rang. A howling figure silhouetted himself against 
the moon and brandished a bloody sword aloft. The wolfish figure 
screamed words of wrath and damnation as he cleaved his way through his 
moredhel brothers. He was Delekhan, former general of Murmandamus, 
leader of the unified tribes of the Northlands, and he was the enemy...<p>

<i>Gorath!</i><p>

The memory detonated into a million fading thoughts, each fleeing after 
the faint echoes of a weak whisper. Before him now there was a new 
image, the face of a fair young girl whose pale blue eyes watched him 
with weary interest. There were others too, all seated like himself 
around a polished council table, all studying, all dissecting. And 
Gorath was the object of their scrutiny.<p>

"I cannot find the truth, my Prince," the tired girl whispered finally, 
quietly. "His mind is chaotic. I find images but I cannot hold them 
long enough to understand."<p>

Narrowing his dark eyes, Prince Arutha glared at Gorath. "He hides his 
thoughts?<p>

"Gorath is moredhel." Pug quickly interceded for his exhausted 
daughter. "Even with Gamina's exceptional talent for sensing thoughts, 
his mind may have many innate psychic defenses. I may need to send for 
one of my advanced students..."<p>

"No need to disturb studies, master magician Pug. The moredhel speaks 
truly."<p>

Council members exchanged surprised glances then turned their attention 
to the aged magician seated next to Pug. Lowering his eyes, the man 
made a dismissive gesture.<p>

Forgive me, I do not mean to presume, but I have looked into his mind 
as well," Makala continued. "War in the Kingdom would have many wide 
ranging effects, not the least of which could lead to a disruption of 
trade between our two worlds. My Emperor of Tsuranuanni would be most 
displeased if our rift-making secrets were seized by barbarians in 
warfare."<p>

Gorath glowered at the Tsurani magician. "Trading agreements not 
withstanding, the moredhel watch your borders, Nighthawks spy on your 
imperial cousins and before the snows there shall be an army come to 
the Kingdom! Heed my words Prince of Krondor! You must prepare your 
troops!"<p>

Anger flashed in the thunderheads of Arutha's eyes as he rose to his 
feet...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
What I must or must not do will not be dictated by a dissident moredhel. 
If not for Locklear's good faith in you, I would have had your head 
staked on a pole and paraded up and down the low quarters of Krondor 
once I saw you!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
I have been tolerant while I listened to your vague 
speculations based on incidental half-heard conversations, but how am I 
to believe what you say? What evidence have you laid before this 
council to prove what Delekhan intends to do?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
What evidence? I bear the humiliation of betraying my vow as a moredhel 
and the indignity of surrendering to a sworn enemy...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>MAKALA:</font>
Why betray Delekhan to the Kingdom of the Isles? Of what benefit to you 
is it to snare him?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
He is leader in name only. However bitter a draught Delekhan may be for 
your kith and kin to drink, magician, his rule is black poison in the 
gullets of me and mine. Already he enslaves my cousins and rapes the 
land.<p>
 
<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Bloody his nose Prince of Krondor. Blunt his swords and the 
unified tribes will cast him down in wrath. Let him cross your Northern 
border, however, and ten other clans will join their strength to his 
and the legacy of Murmandamus will be but a spark next to his glory.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
Where would you have me send my troops? If indeed he intends a strike 
against one of our northernmost possessions, which castle shall I 
garrison for the attack? Highcastle? Ironpass? Northwarden? If I am to 
fight a war, by my teeth tell me where would you have me fight it!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Would that I could tell you! Delekhan holds in good confidence only a 
handful of cowering dogs and, among them, only a few are privy to his 
war plans. His private counsels are restricted to choice individuals, 
his advisors Narab and Nago, his mistress Liallan, his son Moraeulf
and - Nighthawks!<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
He keeps foul company that leader of yours...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Your highness, if you give me leave, I believe I can find the evidence 
of Delekhan's intent. I will need someone to accompany me to Romney and 
supplies for my journey and a small parcel of gold.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
Romney? What do you think you can find in a provincial river town in 
the heart of the Kingdom?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
I aim to catch a bird in flight. Of late Delekhan has emptied a good 
deal of his treasury to revive the service of the Nighthawks. In 
exchange he has demanded tactical information about kingdom holdings...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
He's turned the Guild of Assassins into a guild of spies?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
Only for a time. Although the payments have been left in various hidden 
locales, the messengers were always to rendezvous in Romney. If I go 
there, I may be able to intercept information concerning a forthcoming 
attack. Would such evidence suffice?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
Perhaps. Damn me but I don't trust you Gorath. How do I know that this 
isn't a plot of yours? We can weigh the evidence to our heart's content 
and your cousins could be slitting the throats of my serfs as we sit 
dawdling...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
Go to Romney, but you'll provide for yourself. If this is 
part of some secret moredhel scheme, I'll not look the fool before the 
world. Pug, unroll the map for me...<p>

The scroll smelled of dust.<p>

Scrawled in chicken scratches and spider tracks, tiny lines staggered 
across the moth-eaten paper, indicating the paths that were the major 
roads within the Kingdom.<p>

Pointer in hand, Arutha bent over the map and pointed to a large black 
dot. "We are here in Krondor. At dawn tomorrow you will leave through 
the main gate and rendezvous with your escort, Seigneur James. I know 
you might have preferred Locklear's company, but he has business 
elsewhere.<p>

"You will head to Romney. Providing one of Delekhan's assassins 
doesn't slit your throat first, you should reach the Ursine Ford within 
the month. In Romney you will join a special detachment of King Lyam's 
soldiers staying at the Black Sheep Tavern. They may be of service to 
you."<p>

Nodding, Gorath took in Arutha's advice, listening studiously as the 
Prince reviewed the details. "If you find the evidence, I will act 
only when James has conveyed the information to me. Is that clear? Only 
when I receive James' word. Until then, I wait."<p>

"Understood," Gorath replied.<p>

"Good," Arutha replied, slapping the surface of the table with his 
palm. Looking around the council chamber, he noted the wearied 
expressions of all who sat around the map. "Why don't you let Gamina 
and Makala show you around Krondor? I have a few things I need to 
consider alone."<p>

Reading the offer as a polite dismissal, the worn council members began 
to file out the door, most glad to be on their feet again following the 
grueling session. As Pug passed by, however, Arutha snagged his sleeve 
and drew him back to the table. "If you don't mind, I would have your 
council, cousin Pug."<p> 

"Certainly," Pug replied, resuming his seat. "I am all attention."<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
As I see it, Delekhan could have only two potential targets for attack 
into the Kingdom: Highcastle...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
...and Northwarden.<p> 

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
His fortress at Sar-Sargoth is three hundred miles to the North and I 
doubt he has the resources to defend a line that long.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
So an attack at Northwarden seems unlikely.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
Leaving Highcastle...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
Which is a viable alternative, but neither target seems to have an 
obvious goal. I know you are no field strategist and you hate to become 
involved in state matters but I should like you to delay your return to 
your home at Stardock for a while. I feel...ill at ease.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
You are not alone in that. I too have sensed something unusual in the 
air, but I won't ascribe it to anything as dire as magic. More likely 
we suffer from bad soup.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
Feelings aside I will call up the militia reserves from Malac's Cross, Darkmoor, 
and Lyton and join them to a detachment of the Krondorian Lancers just outside 
of the Dimwood.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
James will send word to me there.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PUG:</font>
What of the garrison?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
It will remain in place. I have considered the option of a full push south and 
it seems unlikely, but I will give Delekhan nothing. Our agreement remains.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>ARUTHA:</font>
Now we wait. Gods help Gorath if he betrays us to the moredhel.<p>

MEETING OWYN IN THE SEWERS</font><p>
</center>

<blockquote>


A shadow approached.<p>

From a murky corner of the room, the figure advanced towards them. Gorath's pulse quickened for 
a moment, but he relaxed slightly as he saw they were not about to be attacked.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
It took you two long enough. I was beginning to think the Mockers had you bagged up again,
Seigneur James. Is everything all right?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Squire, suppose I ignore the fact that this trip is a state secret to which you are not supposed
to be privy AND that we are hurrying out of the sewers instead of leaving by the main gate at 
the proper time. How did you find out we were coming?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Well, after Seigneur Locklear dumped me off after we got here and told me I could go home, I got
bored and decided to check out Krondor. Unfortunately there's nothing much interesting going on 
here, so I decided I would come back to the palace. I tried to pay Gorath an unexpected visit 
last night, but discovered that the guards had been doubled with orders that no one could see 
him. I might have fallen for it if I hadn't heard someone snoring in his cell...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Gorath doesn't snore, I take it.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Not a sound. When I realized that something was in the air I went to find Locklear and 
discovered that he was mysteriously absent, despite a tray of food delivered to his door just 
moments after I slipped away. Finally, I came down here and talked to Limm who told me you had 
been down here earlier this morning. At that point, I realized Arutha meant to slip Gorath out 
of Krondor for some reason...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Are you sure you're not a thief by profession? You think unnervingly like a Mocker I used to 
know.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
So, are we ready? We should probably get moving. Where are we going anyway?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>GORATH:</font>
You cannot accompany us, Owyn. Our mission is much too important.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Quiet, moredhel! I'll handle this.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
But I could jeopardize your mission! Who knows who might take me captive between here and 
Tiburn? If I go back to Krondor now, I might accidentally talk to someone. Besides, I'm from 
the eastern part of the Kingdom. I know the area and I might be able to help...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
For better or worse, you seem determined to hitch your fate to catastrophe. But if you want to 
get yourself killed at a tender young age, who am I to naysay it? I used to pull the same stunts
when Arutha wished to pull out of Krondor...<p>

All right then squire, you can come along, but these are the ground rules. One, I am in charge 
and you do whatever I say without question. Two, under no circumstances do you reveal anything 
about Gorath or our mission to anyone. If someone asks, we will continue what Seigneur Locklear 
suggested - Gorath is an elf. Thirdly, and lastly, you don't wander off on your own. I don't 
care if you're watering the trees, you ask me first. Is all that clear?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Absolutely. Whatever you say.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Stop smiling. You're going to earn your keep. I know I'm going to regret this, but let's get 
moving. We have a long way to go and no time to get there.<p>

Even as they threw the door open, James bit back the impulse to vomit. 
Kingdom soldiers lay scattered about the room, each lying in his own

untouched by murderous hands...<p>
