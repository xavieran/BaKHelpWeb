Halting for a moment to ponder his options, James stared off in the direction of the Kingdom's 
populated heartland. "We'll pass through Malac's Cross or Sethanon if we head this way. Think
that's the best idea?"<p>

None of the cortege of men arrayed against them looked to be in a good mood, and even if they

James sniffed. Rubbing his irritated nose, he struggled against the urge to

Taking drinks from an overly large cup of ale between tales about his mercenaries, he wandered

Raising a single eyebrow at that, the man shook his head. "Those damn Kahooli priests in the 
temple up at Kenting Rush aren't <i>natural</i> I tell you. What pleasures a man's got, they 
want him to give up. All tied up in those damnable codes of piety. What in Tith's name does the

Unnerved by the intensity of the woman's gaze, he sought someone else in the

him, her thin hands gripped tightly around a cloth wrapped bundle in her lap.<p>
"Do I know you, miss?" James asked. "You seem troubled."<p>
"This was to be given to you," she said, her voice breaking as she handed over 
the package. "I was instructed to bring it to you here."<p>
"Instructed?" James unwrapped the bundle and discovered that a single torch was 
within. Baffled by the strange present, he peered hard at her, but she had 
pointed her gaze at the floorboards beneath her feet. Lifting her chin 
delicately, he saw that someone had struck her across the face. "Who did 
this to you and why? <p>
"I do not know," she replied, her voice small in the clatter of pans and pots 
which came from the kitchen. "All I know is that I was to bring this to this 
tavern and give it over to one who looked as you do."

Gorath was about to knock on the door when he heard the shrill voice of a woman calling for
help.<p>
"No one can help you now! Ha ha ha ha!" boomed a raucous male voice. "The Goddess of death<br>
will --"<p>
Before another word could be uttered, Gorath took several steps back and charged at the door, 
hitting it with his shoulder. The door gave way with a splintering "crack!" The force of the 
impact caused him to lose his balance, but he quickly regained it, drawing his sword as he 
quickly surveyed the room.<p>
He found himself eye to eye with a half dressed man wearing a wig. There was no one else in the 
room.<p>
"What did you do with her?" Gorath demanded.<p>
The man sputtered a reply, still trying to catch his breath. "Wha-- who-- I-- what did I do
with WHOM?"<p>
"The woman. We heard a woman yelling for help. What did you do with her?" Gorath repeated, 
more with bewilderment than anger this time.<p>
"I haven't done anything with anyone! I'm an actor. I was just preparing for a play I will be 
performing tonight at The Flying Sow."<p>
Gorath swallowed hard. "A play?" he asked, weakly. "We thought...I mean I thought... Uh, sorry 
about the door! I'll give you 25 sovereigns, or whatever we have left. That should cover it."
The man was still shaking his head when they left.

A balding man with an intense gaze answered James's knock.<p>
"Are you looking to stay in Prank's Stone for awhile?" he wondered. "Do I have a house for
you -- only 30 sovereigns a month!"<p>
"Sorry, we were just passing through. What can you tell us of the people who live in your
houses?" James asked.<p>
"Got a guy who claims he's an actor living in one, and my other place is ABOUT to become
unoccupied. That no good dragon lover has cheated me out of my money for the last time!
Good day!" The subject obviously angered him, because he put an end to the conversation by 
slamming the door.

A smiling man answered the door.<p>
"Come in, come in!" he said with a large grin. "Have I got something to show you!"<p>
Curious, James followed the man into the house. He lead them to a table upon which there was
a bulky object of some kind covered with a cloth. With great flourish the man pulled away the 
cloth revealing a strange metal machine with a funnel at the top and a wooden crank on one side.<p>
"What is it?" asked Owyn.<p>
"It's a gem converter. Currently it will only convert rubies into
emeralds, but I'm working on a formula to convert rubies into diamonds. Say! Perhaps you could 
help me test it? Would you like to give it a try?"

"Hmm. This will do nicely, said the man, holding the ruby up to examine it. He dropped it into

After several revolutions turns, the machine made a strange clanking sound, and a small diamond 
dropped onto the table. The man picked it up.<p>
"Wonderful! It works! Say, as long as you're here would you like me to convert anymore of your 
rubies?"

"After searching through our packs I'm afraid we don't have any rubies," James said.<p>

convert them anyway. How does that sound?"<p>

struck him. "You are one of Count Corvalis' guards aren't you?"<p>

Jerking his thumb back at the way they had come, James related what the franklin had explained to 
them about the spiders in the area. "They asked for you to come and help as soon as possible."<p>

Looking back to the other men who waited in the field, the soldier waved to them and instructed 
a few of them to get someone to go and help out.<p>

"What about us?" James asked.<p>

"Do what you like," the soldier replied. "You lot don't look like poachers anyway. Just don't

Approaching a little more closely, the man stepped past James to have a good look at the boy. 
"Does look a bit like the Count," the man confirmed. "But I can't allow you to go any further 
just based on a faint resemblance and your word. If you wish to keep yourselves alive, I'd 
advise you to turn about."

It was an unusual well.<p>
James ran his hands across the wooden crank, tried to turn it but discovered it was jammed.
Reaching down to get a better grip his fingers scraped against something hard and smooth. It
was a small round lock.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
I believe I'm familiar with this kind of lock. In days past some men required their ladies to 
wear <i>locked</i> undergarments as an assurance of 
chastity while they were away. As the stories go, the men gave the keys to these undergarments
to none but their closest and most trusted friends. Naturally, the ladies did everything in their
power to convince the friends to use their key to remove the uncomfortable things, and many 
illicit romances were said to have developed. The lock was always replaced before the husband 
returned home, but after unlocking the device the key was often left with the friend for the next
time the husband went away. In the meantime, the secret lovers would sometimes find an abandoned
well, put on one of these locks and use the key to hide love notes.<p>

Shall we try to open it?

James checked their keys.<p>
Finding a virtue key he moved to the well, found the lock and inserted the small key, turning
it gently. The lock was a bit rusty, but after a few seconds he was able to twist the key in the
lock, producing a satisfying "click." The handle now unlocked he cranked it in a clockwise motion
and after about a dozen turns the dry bucket emerged from the well. Searching inside they found 
something small and covered with dirt and leaves. It was a Knight's piece!

"Oh, its <i>occurred</i> to them," the barkeeper replied. "So far, they're not so mean spirited 
yet we can't keep them corralled. But things keep up as they are, these soldiers will get like 
wild dogs and there'll be nothing to keep them from fighting amongst themselves. The same is 
true down at the Candlemaker's Grin tavern. It'll be a bloodier war than any fought at 
Northwarden or Highcastle."<p>
"Sad state of affairs," Owyn agreed. "What if we could get you the alcohol?"<p>
"Could you now?" the barkeep said with astonishment. "You know where there might be supplies?"<p>
Owyn waved off Lurough's enthusiasm. "Not precisely, no. But we will look around and see what

Glee dancing in the barkeep's eyes, he was barely able to contain himself as he escorted them 
to the rear room of the tavern. "There may not be much there, but at least it'll keep a riot 
from breaking out in here!" he squeaked, giving in to an urge to caper now that he was out of 
the sight of bar patrons. "Let me make this up to you!"<p>
Rummaging through the goods in the back room, he found a long object wrapped in burlap and 
handed it over to them.<p>

laughter. "Oh, this is going to be the best joke yet!"<p>
Still laughing he retreated into his house, refusing to answer any more questions.

They were greeted at the door by a very tired looking woman. "Good day travellers. How can I
be of service to you?"<p>
"What can you tell us of Kenting Rush? We are curious about this place in which you live," James
said kindly.<p>
"Well, sirs. It is a nice enough place, though lately there have been some shady looking 
characters hanging around by the well." She paused for a moment, then pointed to a nearby field,
"My husband is out harvesting grain. He works over there. Let's see, what else can I tell you? 
Oh, yes! Be very careful of the sorcerer who lives down the road. He has a habit of tricking 
people out of their money; asks them three questions, the first two are very simple but no one 
has ever answered the last one correctly."<p>
They thanked the woman for her time and were on their way.

Gorath was about to knock, but his knuckles touched nothing save air as the door swung out of 
his reach.<p>
Accepting the mysterious invitation they entered the dwelling slowly. There were shelves on 
every wall, and books on every shelf. Owyn's eyes fell upon a wooden staff in the corner of the 
room.<p>
"Ah, you've already found my Lightning Staff. You like it, I can tell." The voice came from a 
man sitting on a chair in one corner of the room. The table in front of him was stacked with 
papers making his huddled form hard to see. "I am Shoral. Prove your worthiness to me and I will
give it to you.<p>

His eyes little more than slits, the magician replied slowly, "Not a game." He turned to stare

and I shall extract a payment in gold. Care to try your luck?"<p>

YES:</font><p>

"Very good, my friend," Shoral muttered, "you have but two questions remaining." He shifted in

Owyn smiled broadly. "I'm sorry, my mistake. YES! I can see you just fine." He winked at the
sorcerer. "Foolish me, and I thought your last question was going to be hard -- perhaps even 
IMPOSSIBLE -- to answer."<p>
Without waiting for a response, he grabbed the Lightning Staff and began to head for the door.
"Come on," he shouted over his shoulder, "We better leave. Now!"

brushed aside by two rather large hands, one of which curled into a rather large fist and hit
Locklear, rather hard, in the face.<p>

A pleasant looking man stood near a large wire lined cage that seemed to take up almost the 
entire room. It was alive with pigeons, and the man was stroking a small one, trying to coax it 
back inside. "Come on now," he said gently. "Come on, get in there." The bird refused to
cooperate.<p>
"Ahem." James cleared his throat causing the man to look up with surprise. The bird flew out of 
his hand and began to circle near the ceiling.<p>
"Blast it. These birds are no better than kids. Won't do a darn thing you tell 'em to." In the 
corner, the young boy smiled. "I hear talk of a magic spell called, 'Thy Master's Will' that is 
supposed to command flying beasts -- but I think it's more for Wyverns than anything else. You 
need one of their eggs too, I guess."<p>

Guards escorted them inside.<p>

Near the pasture gate and past some of the more offensive smelling horse stalls, an older woman 
sat on a large oak bench, her gaze stern and unflinching as she looked into the faces of the 
numerous military captains who were seated on the floor around her. Looking up, she didn't
appear amused that her council had been interrupted.<p>

"Yes, what is it?" she asked of Owyn. "You bring news?"<p>
"Of a sorts," Owyn said awkwardly. Quickly he summarized the things which he had been told about 
the brewing difficulties with the soldiers and the need for supplies for the taverns.<p>

Angered, Count Corvalis turned on Owyn and shook his head. "I can't <i>believe</i> you would 
interrupt this meeting for so trivial an issue."<p>
"You do not have permission to speak, <i>Count</i>," Lady Boswich replied, an iron hard edge to 
her voice. "If anything, their request is the most reasonable thing I've yet heard from anyone 
in this room today. Most of you have been preening and prattling on like you were cocks in a 
hen house, but I'll have no more of it. It's time we addressed our problems here!"<p>
Uncomfortable to be witness to his uncle's humiliation, Owyn said nothing as the Lady returned 
her attention to him. Her faint smile painting aged lines across her face, she motioned for the 
doors to be reopened for them. "You will find that I have reserves of alcohol hidden in secret 
chests located near here. They are hidden behind an illusion of a mountain that was created for 
another purpose."<p>
Owyn staggered. The thought of an illusion of a mountain boggled his mind, the sheer amount of 
power necessary fantastically large. "But who..."<p>

"It is not important," she replied. "Go from this place and bear east into a small canyon. That 
which appears to be the canyon's end is an illusion and may be passed through. Beyond it you 
shall find the chests of which I speak."<p>
Nodding his head, Owyn bowed respectfully to the Lady and allowed himself to be escorted with
Gorath back outside.
