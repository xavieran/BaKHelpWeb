So barkeep, what sort of fare do you offer in the Duck's Head?<p>

Only the best in all the Kingdom! What can Peter interest you in today? A bit of roast chicken 
with a hunk of cheese? Spitted roast with steamed potato eyes? Or what ho, the house special, a 
duck baked in a lemons and stuffed with rose peel crumbs! How does that strike you?<p>

I don't suppose any of those come in servings for the road?<p>

We wouldn't mind sharing with someone...<p>

Truly, I would like to help you, but the rooms I do have to let are full up and I don't think 
my skully would want to share. The room is only just large enough for him to squeeze into and 
it's a tight fit as it is. With three of you in there, we'd have to stack you like ricks of
wood. I'm sorry...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Being right across the street from the Count, you must see him quite a bit.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PETER:</font>
Actually, no. The Count is quiet, likes to keep his own company, mostly. He's not one much for 
drinking with the commoners. His whole family has been much the same way with the exception of 
his daughter...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Does he have any unusual callers at his house?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PETER:</font>
There aren't many that would visit him. Don't get me wrong, he isn't a bad sort but he can be 
unpleasant at times. About the only people in and out of there are Ugyne's suitors and the men 
who work for the Count.<p>

James's stomach grumbled.<p>

Waiting until another patron had finished placing his order for a roast hen and a tankard of ale,
the seigneur beckoned the tavern keeper away from his other duties, hoping both for information 
and perhaps a bit to eat.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PETER:</font>
I hope you haven't come looking for company tonight. The Duck's Head's a bit quiet this night. 
You'd think someone left a corpse a'laying in the middle of my floor during the dinner hour.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
They didn't did they?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PETER:</font>
Ha, no! Except for the attempt to poison the Count's family a few months ago, things have been 
fairly sleepy around here in Cavall Keep. Farmer folk here tend to keep to themselves and worry 
about their crops, not each other.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Who do you think tried to poison them?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PETER:</font>
If you heard word from the Keep, you'd think no one did. They're a brave lot, all acting almost 
as if it didn't happen. Wouldn't matter to me if I hadn't of lost my best kitchen boy when he 
tasted the port. I've got a new boy that works for me, but I miss my old scully. He was a good 
lad... So... What can I get for you fellows, now that I've talked your ears off?<p>

Evening gents. Just let me know if you need anything.<p>

I can't honestly say its on my list of ambitions at the moment, no. Having problems with the 
help?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PETER:</font>
I wouldn't call it problems so much as disappointments. I don't know what to say to the lad. 
He's a good enough boy, kind, honest, hard-working. But all in all, he doesn't have the faintest
idea which end of the pan's the handle. I've tried for weeks to teach him how to cook so the 
wife and I could take some time off, but when it comes to cooking he's as dense as the 
Thunderhell. I don't know what else to do. But enough about me. What can Peter do for you?<p>

Did Ugyne ever tell you how it was that Neville died? I was only seven Midsummers when it 
happened.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PETER:</font>
That was a terrible, terrible day. I thought Ugyne would come apart then, but she has quite a 
bit of her mother in her, lot of iron. They dug for four days, poor men. Never were able to 
recover the little tot's body from all the rubble. I still can't imagine what the Count must 
have been thinking...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Uncle? What did he do?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PETER:</font>
I mean, why did he hire that man Sandau to build the wine cellar for them in the first place?
He had a bit of a reputation as a drunk as it was, and three times while he was building it the 
Count discovered him so capped he couldn't even stand up straight to take his thrashing. The 
Count should have known the cellar would be unstable... I'm sorry, I'm not being fair. Of course,
none of us had a way of knowing. The Count wouldn't have purposely had the cellar built shoddy. Why 
waste his money?<p>

Navon Du Sandau. Know anything about him?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>PETER:</font>
It's a pity he doesn't like the man. He's perfectly charming, handsome, mannered if you haven't 
crossed him, but zealous if he thinks you're doing something wrong to someone. He'd be just the 
cat's whiskers for Ugyne...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>JAMES:</font>
Any idea where we could find him?<p>

He's a businessman, so it may be difficult to track him down. I think he lives in Kenting
