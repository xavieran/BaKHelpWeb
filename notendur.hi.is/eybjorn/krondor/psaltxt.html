<h2>PSALMS OF DALA</h2></center><hr>
<blockquote><blockquote><font size=+1>
Essentially a book of prayers, most of the psalms dealt with the mythology
surrounding the defender goddess and her frequent clashes with the war god,
Tith Onanka. It advised which prayers should be said upon waking, which
should be used before sleeping, before eating, before entering inns, and
most importantly, which should be mouthed before entering battle so that the
defender goddess would add her favor to the faithful's ability to defend him
or herself. It also mentioned in passing that the goddess would also lend her favor to those
that drank the Dalatail Milk sometimes sold by her followers.
