Slamming Owyn flat against the mineshaft walls, Locklear narrowly leapt for cover himself as
something skidded along the rocky floor. Abruptly the glowing cone of fire winked out of

Bloddy awful hammer! You'd best 'ave a demon in your bones. You 'ave come to take a whack at
killing the beastie 'ave you not?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Beastie?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NADDUR:</font>
Beastie, aye! 'alf a week ago we 'eard something fierce a'bayin' in the mine, terrible cold like.
Of course a dwarf knows the sound instant whether he's heard it before or not - Brak Nurr. Curse
of every hole delver since first dwarves took up hammers.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
I've never heard of them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NADDUR:</font>
No one has in quite a while, laddie. There 'asn't been a Brak Nurr in the upper mines for well 
on since Delong the Great laid claim to the Kingdom of the Isles. We thought we'd laid low the 
lot o' them but the kobolds are stirring them up on their quest.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
Kobolds?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NADDUR:</font>
Your folk call them gnomes. They used to worship a dragon what lived down here, but when the 
dragon disappeared, they thought the dwarven folk 'id him away. Every now and again their leader
Feydhir takes a notion to undertake a holy quest to find him. This time they must've woke up a 
clutch of Brak Nurr. Now the Nurr have collapsed the main passage an' kilt thirty of our kin.
We've a reward to whomever can do it in - if you're of a mind and 'ave the spirit that is.

they'll drop a boulder on your head sure enow. We've already 'ad a few bravos what's come in

themselves beyond get themselves so mangled they needed the help of a temple. I'd be as 
wary of them though as I would be of the beastie. They, none of them, want else but then

Watch what I do and carefully. I don't want ta be repeating meself more often than necessary.

'cross the stone... It's like this.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>LOCKLEAR:</font>
That's interesting... You sharpen the blade so the metal's edge has contrary planes. Opposite sides, opposite directions
in the grain. Should make for an interesting cut.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NADDUR:</font>
It'll make for a cut that yar opponent won't quick forget. The weaponcrafting lesson's over,

Overheard, my toes! You've been poking about, 'aven't you? No harm in it though. Rhuargh was a

last near ten year ago. I've 'eard our King Dolgan say the elven consort Tomas was present when
Rhuargh passed on, but I'm scarce to believe it. The chamber is a marvel though, buried somewhere
beyond where our digging is at the moment. At one time there was quite a bit of treasure there -
an unfortunate large amount of it concealed in chests with moredhel wordlocks - and perhaps there
may still be. Come back later and mayhap we'll see it together!<p>

A more bastardly lock never there has been crafted, not by dwarf nor man. It's got little wheels
what a body turns, each representing a letter of the alphabet. In order to open the chest, you've
got to make the letters spell out a word what the lock's designer had in mind to open it up.
Most 'ave a clue plate attached to the front what's written in moredhel - in case the lockmaker 
forgets the word. Of course the clue plate's of no use to the vast majority of Kingdom folk.
Written in bloddy moredhel!<p>

They were not alone.<p>

Owyn's pulse quickened as he saw the lone figure approach; but when it became apparent they were
not being attacked, he relaxed a bit, squinted slightly in an attempt to see who was about to 
join them.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NADDUR:</font>
A'heard you comin' down the passageway, and for a moment, I thought you might be another o' them 
beasties, come to rattle me bones. I suppose we're all a wee bit jumpy down here as yet.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Hope we didn't startle you too badly. We were just looking around for a way to get to Elvandar. 
I think I'd heard once it was the other side of the Grey Towers.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NADDUR:</font>
You've found the way! These mines stretch all the way from one side o' the Grey Towers to the 
other. We had a collapse here, but we've broke through about an 'alf an 'our ago. I saw me 
brother McCannur for the first time in months! Oh, but there some tragic loss too. There was a 
falls in the caverns and the passages to it were terrible damaged. I don't know that we'll ever 
see it again. Terrible, terrible mess those Brak Nurr made.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
But we can get through to Elvandar?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NADDUR:</font>
Aye! But I advise you to stick to the main passages as there's some windy bits that can cause 
some humans distress. As a common we wouldn't let you go alone as you'd get lost, but only the 
major passages 'ave been cleared. You'll do safe enow.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Before we go, could we ask you a few questions?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NADDUR:</font>
I don't see why not. Whadda ya need to know, laddie?

I'd not expected ta see you for some while. Did ya get lost in the Mac?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
No, it just occurred to me that perhaps you could answer a few questions for me.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NADDUR:</font>
I canna guarantee I can tell ya what ya wish ta know, but I'll do me best. Ask your questions.

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
I'm surprised we haven't seen many cases of Quegian Fever up this way. They're having problems
with it down at the Abbey of Ishap at Sarth.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NADDUR:</font>
Ach! If you're going to talk about Bourgalan, call it by its name arights, not by that Keshian
bark...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Sarth was dwarven?<p> 

<font color=#ffcc00>NADDUR:</font>
Not the abbey itself, no, but the caverns beneath! It was the greatest emerald mine the dwarves
ever delved, the Mac Bourgalan Dok. It ran for miles in every direction and part o' the chambers
ran right beneath where the Abbey now stands, though I understand those silly priests 'ave
stuffed the tunnels to the rafters with books. We'd still own the caverns now, but we made an 
arrangement with Mejakaar Blackpatch when he moved into the keep that 'ad been built over one of
the entrances...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
And Mejakaar still owns the mine?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NADDUR:</font>
Aye, if corpses can be said to own anything. 'e's been dead a long while, even as dwarves reckon
time. The mines are the property now of the Brothers of Ishap, though I doubt they know how to 
get from their vaults to the main passages of the mine.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
After we leave the Mac Mordain Cadal, which way will we take to Elvandar? I've never been there.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NADDUR:</font>
Ya don't think for a moment it's going to be as easy as that now do ya, lad? The elves don't
exactly invite the rest o' the world in for pleasant tea parties and I think they'll take 
particular exception to your moredhel friend here.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Oh, he's not moredhel, he's...<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NADDUR:</font>
An elf what doesn't know the way to Elvandar? I'm no fool and you'll be an even sorrier whelp if
you try that one on one of Warleader Tomas' border rangers. They'll 'ave the both of you 'anging
by your ankles from a tree in a sparrow's fall. If what I 'ear from me brother McCannur is true,
they may even 'ave cause to shoot your friend on sight.<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>OWYN:</font>
Why? What would they have against Gorath?<p>

<font color=#ffcc00>NADDUR:</font>
Not 'im personally, again the moredhel. I've not sure o' the details, but I've 'eard the
moredhel are pressing the borders near Moraelin. I'm sure my brother McCannur ken tell ya more
aboot it than I. If 'e's not still in the Cadal, he may be on the road to Caldara.<p>
