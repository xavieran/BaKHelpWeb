A treacherously narrow path wound its way up to the front gates of Northwarden
Castle, scarcely wide enough to allow two men to walk abreast.

The path turned.<p>
The road before them was well travelled. Locklear saw it switch back several times 
before climbing towards a large garrison. "Northwarden," he said. "Do you think 
we should go in for supplies?"

After half an hour's journey, they had returned once more to the main road.

Locklear strolled into the trees.
Seeing a suspiciously ordered pile of leaves, he prodded its depths but was 
relieved to find that no one had left a trap behind. Still curious, he continued 
to burrow.

Everywhere Locklear looked, polished metal gleamed. As much a temple to war as any 
Temple of Tith, the cramped shop offered a startling variety of weapons and 
armor.<p>

A sign hung on the wall.<p>

<i>Mender On Call. Ask the Shopkeeper!</i><p>

The shopkeeper whistled.<p>

Cringing at the sound, Locklear glanced up to see what bargain the keeper wished to 
call their attention to, but instead it seemed the man was calling to someone 
else. "Didn't mean to startle you," the man said. "Just trying to find if my 
mender is still about today."<p>

"You have a tinker in your employ?" Locklear asked.<p>

"Sometimes, when he chooses to show up," the shopkeeper said amiably. "He can 
fix nearly anything---crossbows, armor, swords. You name it. And his work looks 
like brand new. Would you like to speak to him?"
