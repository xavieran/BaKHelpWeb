To the God Kahooli,<p>
Your priests have become lost in their ways and have ignored the 
pleas of your faithful. It is my most pious wish, therefore, that the High 
Priests of Your Temple in Kenting Rush be stricken with boils until they
have learned the error of their ways.<p>

Proprietor of the Dagger & Star Tavern<p>
